<p><span class="i10 pmb2">MY LORD,</span></p>

<p>I cannot begin my address to your lordship better
than in the words of Virgil:</p>

<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">----<i>Quod optanti div&ucirc;m promittere nemo</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Auderet, volvenda dies, en, attulit ultro.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Seven years together I have concealed the longing
which I had to appear before you: a time as tedious
as &AElig;neas passed in his wandering voyage, before
  <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
he reached the promised Italy. But I considered,
that nothing which my meanness could produce,
was worthy of your patronage. At last this
happy occasion offered, of presenting to you the
best poem of the best poet. If I balked this opportunity,
I was in despair of finding such another;
and, if I took it, I was still uncertain whether you
would vouchsafe to accept it from my hands. It
was a bold venture which I made, in desiring your
permission to lay my unworthy labours at your feet.
But my rashness has succeeded beyond my hopes;
and you have been pleased not to suffer an old man
to go discontented out of the world, for want of
that protection, of which he had been so long ambitious.
I have known a gentleman in disgrace,
and not daring to appear before King Charles the
Second, though he much desired it: at length he
took the confidence to attend a fair lady to the
court, and told his majesty, that, under her protection,
he had presumed to wait on him. With the
same humble confidence, I present myself before
your lordship, and, attending on Virgil, hope a gracious
reception. The gentleman succeeded, because
the powerful lady was his friend; but I have
too much injured my great author, to expect he
should intercede for me. I would have translated
him; but, according to the literal French and Italian
phrases, I fear I have <i>traduced</i> him. It is the
fault of many a well-meaning man, to be officious
in a wrong place, and do a prejudice where he had
endeavoured to do a service. Virgil wrote his
Georgics in the full strength and vigour of his age,
when his judgment was at the height, and before
his fancy was declining. He had (according to our
homely saying) his full swing at this poem, beginning
it about the age of thirty-five, and scarce concluding
it before he arrived at forty. It is observed,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
both of him and Horace, (and I believe it will
hold in all great poets,) that, though they wrote
before with a certain heat of genius which inspired
them, yet that heat was not perfectly digested.
There is required a continuance of warmth, to ripen
the best and noblest fruits. Thus Horace, in his
First and Second Book of Odes, was still rising, but
came not to his meridian till the Third; after which,
his judgment was an overpoise to his imagination:
he grew too cautious to be bold enough; for he
descended in his Fourth by slow degrees, and, in his
Satires and Epistles, was more a philosopher and a
critic than a poet. In the beginning of summer,
the days are almost at a stand, with little variation
of length or shortness, because at that time the diurnal
motion of the sun partakes more of a right
line than of a spiral. The same is the method of
nature in the frame of man. He seems at forty to
be fully in his summer tropic; somewhat before,
and somewhat after, he finds in his soul but small
increases or decays. From fifty to three score, the
balance generally holds even, in our colder climates:
for he loses not much in fancy; and judgement,
which is the effect of observation, still increases.
His succeeding years afford him little
more than the stubble of his own harvest: yet, if
his constitution be healthful, his mind may still retain
a decent vigour; and the gleanings of that
Ephraim, in comparison with others, will surpass
the vintage of Abiezer. I have called this somewhere,
by a bold metaphor, a green old age; but
Virgil has given me his authority for the figure&mdash;</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>Among those few who enjoy the advantage of a
latter spring, your lordship is a rare example; who,
being now arrived at your great climacteric, yet
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
give no proof of the least decay of your excellent
judgment and comprehension of all things which
are within the compass of human understanding.
Your conversation is as easy as it is instructive;
and I could never observe the least vanity, or the
least assuming, in any thing you said, but a natural
unaffected modesty, full of good sense, and well digested;
a clearness of notion, expressed in ready
and unstudied words. No man has complained, or
even can, that you have discoursed too long on any
subject; for you leave us in an eagerness of learning
more; pleased with what we hear, but not satisfied,
because you will not speak so much as we
could wish. I dare not excuse your lordship from
this fault; for, though it is none in you, it is one
to all who have the happiness of being known to
you. I must confess, the critics make it one of
Virgil's beauties, that, having said what he thought
convenient, he always left somewhat for the imagination
of his readers to supply; that they might
gratify their fancies, by finding more in what he
had written, than at first they could; and think
they had added to his thought, when it was all
there before-hand, and he only saved himself the
expence of words. However it was, I never went
from your lordship, but with a longing to return,
or without a hearty curse to him who invented ceremonies
in the world, and put me on the necessity
of withdrawing, when it was my interest, as
well as my desire, to have given you a much longer
trouble. I cannot imagine, (if your lordship will
give me leave to speak my thoughts,) but you have
had a more than ordinary vigour in your youth;
for too much of heat is required at first, that there
may not too little be left at last. A prodigal fire
is only capable of large remains; and yours, my
lord, still burns the clearer in declining. The
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
blaze is not so fierce as at the first; but the smoke
is wholly vanished; and your friends, who stand
about you, are not only sensible of a cheerful
warmth, but are kept at an awful distance by its
force. In my small observations of mankind, I
have ever found, that such as are not rather too full
of spirit when they are young, degenerate to dulness
in their age. Sobriety in our riper years is
the effect of a well-concocted warmth: but, where
the principles are only phlegm, what can be expected
from the waterish matter, but an insipid manhood,
and a stupid old infancy&mdash;discretion in leading-strings,
and a confirmed ignorance on crutches?
Virgil, in his Third Georgic, when he describes a
colt, who promises a courser for the race, or for the
field of battle, shews him the first to pass the
bridge, which trembles under him, and to stem the
torrent of the flood. His beginnings must be in
rashness&mdash;a noble fault: but time and experience
will correct that error, and tame it into a deliberate
and well-weighed courage, which knows both to be
cautious and to dare, as occasion offers. Your
lordship is a man of honour, not only so unstained,
but so unquestioned, that you are the living standard
of that heroic virtue; so truly such, that if I
would flatter you, I could not. It takes not from
you, that you were born with principles of generosity
and probity; but it adds to you, that you
have cultivated nature, and made those principles
the rule and measure of all your actions. The
world knows this, without my telling; yet poets
have a right of recording it to all posterity:</p>

<p>Epaminondas, Lucullus, and the two first C&aelig;sars,
were not esteemed the worse commanders, for having
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
made philosophy and the liberal arts their
study. Cicero might have been their equal, but
that he wanted courage. To have both these virtues,
and to have improved them both with a softness of
manners and a sweetness of conversation&mdash;few of
our nobility can fill that character. One there is,
and so conspicuous by his own light, that he needs
not</p>

<p>To be nobly born, and of an ancient family, is in
the extremes of fortune, either good or bad; for
virtue and descent are no inheritance. A long series
of ancestors shews the native with great advantage
at the first; but, if he any way degenerate
from his line, the least spot is visible on ermine.
But, to preserve this whiteness in its original purity,
you, my lord, have, like that ermine, forsaken
the common tract of business, which is not always
clean: you have chosen for yourself a private
greatness, and will not be polluted with ambition.
It has been observed in former times, that none
have been so greedy of employments, and of managing
the public, as they who have least deserved
their stations. But such only merit to be called
patriots, under whom we see their country flourish.
I have laughed sometimes, (for who would always
be a Heraclitus?) when I have reflected on those
men, who from time to time have shot themselves
into the world. I have seen many successions of
them; some bolting out upon the stage with vast
applause, and others hissed off, and quitting it with
disgrace. But, while they were in action, I have constantly
observed, that they seemed desirous to retreat
from business; greatness, they said, was nauseous,
and a crowd was troublesome: a quiet privacy was
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
their ambition. Some few of them, I believe, said
this in earnest, and were making a provision against
future want, that they might enjoy their age with
ease. They saw the happiness of a private life, and
promised to themselves a blessing, which every day
it was in their power to possess. But they deferred
it, and lingered still at court, because they
thought they had not yet enough to make them
happy: they would have more, and laid in, to make
their solitude luxurious:&mdash;a wretched philosophy,
which Epicurus never taught them in his garden.
They loved the prospect of this quiet in reversion,
but were not willing to have it in possession: they
would first be old, and make as sure of health and
life, as if both of them were at their dispose. But
put them to the necessity of a present choice, and
they preferred continuance in power; like the
wretch who called Death to his assistance, but refused
him when he came. The great Scipio was
not of their opinion, who indeed sought honours in
his youth, and endured the fatigues with which he
purchased them. He served his country when it
was in need of his courage and conduct, till he
thought it was time to serve himself; but dismounted
from the saddle when he found the beast
which bore him began to grow restiff and ungovernable.
But your lordship has given us a better
example of moderation. You saw betimes, that ingratitude
is not confined to commonwealths; and
therefore, though you were formed alike for the
greatest of civil employments and military commands,
yet you pushed not your fortune to rise in
either, but contented yourself with being capable,
as much as any whosoever of defending your country
with your sword, or assisting it with your counsel,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
when you were called.<a id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> For the rest, the respect
and love which was paid you, not only in the
province where you live, but generally by all who
had the happiness to know you, was a wise exchange
for the honours of the court&mdash;a place of
forgetfulness, at the best, for well-deservers. It is
necessary, for the polishing of manners, to have
breathed that air; but it is infectious, even to the
best morals, to live always in it. It is a dangerous
commerce, where an honest man is sure at the
first of being cheated, and he recovers not his loses,
but by learning to cheat others. The undermining
smile becomes at length habitual; and the drift of
his plausible conversation is only to flatter one, that
he may betray another. Yet it is good to have
been a looker on, without venturing to play; that
a man may know false dice another time, though
he never means to use them. I commend not him
who never knew a court, but him who forsakes it
because he knows it. A young man deserves no
praise, who, out of melancholy zeal, leaves the
world before he has well tried it, and runs headlong
into religion. He who carries a maidenhead
into a cloister, is sometimes apt to lose it there,
and to repent of his repentance. He only is like
to endure austerities, who has already found the inconvenience
of pleasures: for almost every man
will be making experiments in one part or another
of his life; and the danger is the less when we are
young; for, having tried it early, we shall not be
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
apt to repeat it afterwards. Your lordship therefore
may properly be said to have chosen a retreat,
and not to have chosen it till you had maturely
weighed the advantages of rising higher, with the
hazards of the fall.</p>

<p>was thought by a poet to be one of the requisites
to a happy life. Why should a reasonable man put
it into the power of Fortune to make him miserable,
when his ancestors have taken care to release him
from her? Let him venture, says Horace, <i>qui zonam
perdidit</i>. He, who has nothing, plays securely; for
he may win, and cannot be poorer if he loses: but
he who is born to a plentiful estate, and is ambitious
of offices at court, sets a stake to Fortune,
which she can seldom answer. If he gains nothing,
he loses all, or part of what was once his own; and,
if he gets, he cannot be certain but he may refund.
In short, however he succeeds, it is covetousness
that induced him first to play; and covetousness is
the undoubted sign of ill sense at bottom. The odds
are against him, that he loses; and one loss may be
of more consequence to him than all his former winnings.
It is like the present war of the Christians
against the Turk: every year they gain a victory,
and by that a town; but, if they are once defeated,
they lose a province at a blow, and endanger
the safety of the whole empire. You, my lord, enjoy
your quiet in a garden, where you have not
only the leisure of thinking, but the pleasure to
think of nothing which can discompose your mind.
A good conscience is a port which is land-locked on
every side, and where no winds can possibly invade,
no tempests can arise. There a man may
stand upon the shore, and not only see his own
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
image, but that of his Maker, clearly reflected
from the undisturbed and silent waters. Reason
was intended for a blessing; and such it is to men
of honour and integrity, who desire no more than
what they are able to give themselves; like the
happy old Corycian, whom my author describes in
his Fourth Georgic, whose fruits and sallads, on
which he lived contented, were all of his own
growth, and his own plantation. Virgil seems to
think, that the blessings of a country-life are not
complete without an improvement of knowledge
by contemplation and reading:</p>

</div></div>
</div>

<p>It is but half possession, not to understand that
happiness which we possess. A foundation of good
sense, and a cultivation of learning, are required to
give a seasoning to retirement, and make us taste
the blessing. God has bestowed on your lordship
the first of these; and you have bestowed on yourself
the second. Eden was not made for beasts,
though they were suffered to live in it, but for
their master, who studied God in the works of his
creation. Neither could the devil have been happy
there with all his knowledge; for he wanted innocence
to make him so. He brought envy, malice,
and ambition, into Paradise, which soured to him
the sweetness of the place. Wherever inordinate
affections are, 'tis hell. Such only can enjoy the
country, who are capable of thinking when they
are there, and have left their passions behind them
in the town. Then they are prepared for solitude;
and, in that solitude, is prepared for them,</p>

<p>Virgil may be reckoned the first who introduced
three new kinds of poetry among the Romans, which
he copied after three the greatest masters of Greece.
Theocritus and Homer have still disputed for the advantage
over him in Pastoral and Heroics; but I
think all are unanimous in giving him the precedence
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
to Hesiod in his "Georgics." The truth of
it is, the sweetness and rusticity of a Pastoral cannot
be so well expressed in any other tongue as in
the Greek, when rightly mixed and qualified with
the Doric dialect; nor can the majesty of a Heroic
poem anywhere appear so well as in this language,
which has a natural greatness in it, and can he often
rendered more deep and sonorous by the pronunciation
of the Ionians. But, in the middle
style, where the writers in both tongues are on a
level, we see how far Virgil has excelled all who
have written in the same way with him.</p>

<p>There has been abundance of criticism spent on
Virgil's "Pastorals" and "&AElig;ne&iuml;s:" but the "Georgics"
are a subject which none of the critics have
sufficiently taken into their consideration; most of
them passing it over in silence, or casting it under
the same head with pastoral: a division by no means
proper, unless we suppose the style of a husbandman
ought to be imitated in a Georgic, as that of
a shepherd is in a Pastoral. But, though the scene
of both these poems lies in the same place, the
speakers in them are of a quite different character,
since the precepts of husbandry are not to be delivered
with the simplicity of a ploughman, but with
the address of a poet. No rules, therefore, that
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
relate to pastoral, can any way affect the Georgics,
which fall under that class of poetry which consists
in giving plain and direct instructions to the reader;
whether they be moral duties, as those of
Theognis and Pythagoras, or philosophical speculations,
as those of Aratus and Lucretius, or rules of
practice, as those of Hesiod and Virgil. Among
these different kinds of subjects, that which the
Georgic goes upon, is, I think, the meanest and
least improving, but the most pleasing and delightful.
Precepts of morality, besides the natural corruption
of our tempers, which makes us averse to
them, are so abstracted from ideas of sense, that
they seldom give an opportunity for those beautiful
descriptions and images which are the spirit
and life of poetry. Natural philosophy has indeed
sensible objects to work upon; but then it often
puzzles the reader with the intricacy of its notion,
and perplexes him with the multitude of its
disputes. But this kind of poetry I am now speaking
of, addresses itself wholly to the imagination:
it is altogether conversant among the fields and
woods, and has the most delightful part of nature
for its province. It raises in our minds a pleasing
variety of scenes and landscapes, whilst it teaches
us, and makes the driest of its precepts look like a
description. <i>A Georgic therefore is some part of
the science of husbandry put into a pleasing dress, and
set off with all the beauties and embellishments of
poetry.</i> Now, since this science of husbandry is of
a very large extent, the poet shows his skill in
singling out such precepts to proceed on, as are
useful, and at the same time most capable of ornament.
Virgil was so well acquainted with this secret,
that, to set off his Georgic, he has run into a
set of precepts, which are almost foreign to his
subject, in that beautiful account he gives us of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
signs in nature, which precede the changes of the
weather.</p>

<p>And, if there be so much art in the choice of fit
precepts, there is much more required in the treating
of them, that they may fall in after each other
by a natural unforced method, and show themselves
in the best and most advantageous light. They
should all be so finely wrought together in the same
piece, that no coarse seam may discover where they
join; as, in a curious brede of needle-work, one
colour falls away by such just degrees, and another
rises so insensibly, that we see the variety, without
being able to distinguish the total vanishing of the
one from the first appearance of the other. Nor is
it sufficient to range and dispose this body of precepts
into a clear and easy method, unless they are
delivered to us in the most pleasing and agreeable
manner: for there are several ways of conveying the
same truth to the mind of man; and to chuse the
pleasantest of these ways, is that which chiefly distinguishes
poetry from prose, and makes Virgil's
rules of husbandry pleasanter to read than Varro's.
Where the prose-writer tells us plainly what ought
to be done, the poet often conceals the precept in a
description, and represents his countryman performing
the action in which he would instruct his
reader. Where the one sets out, as fully and distinctly
as he can, all the parts of the truth which
he would communicate to us, the other singles out
the most pleasing circumstance of this truth, and
so conveys the whole in a more diverting manner
to the understanding. I shall give one instance,
out of a multitude of this nature, that might be
found in the Georgics, where the reader may see
the different ways Virgil has taken to express the
same thing, and how much pleasanter every manner
of expression is, than the plain and direct mention
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
of it would have been. It is in the Second
Georgic, where he tells us what trees will bear
grafting on each other:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Et s&aelig;pe alterius ramos impune videmus</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Vertere in alterius, mutatamque insita mala</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ferre pyrum, et prunis lapidosa rubescere corna.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>&mdash;Steriles platani malos gessere valentes:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Castane&aelig; fagus, ornusque incanuit albo</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Flore pyri; glandemque sues fregere sub ulmis.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>----Nec longum tempus; et ingens</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Exiit ad c&aelig;lum ramis felicibus arbos;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Miraturque novas frondes, et non sua poma.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here, we see, the poet considered all the effects
of this union between trees of different kinds, and
took notice of that effect which had the most surprise,
and by consequence the most delight in it, to
express the capacity that was in them of being thus
united. This way of writing is every where much
in use among the poets, and is particularly practised
by Virgil, who loves to suggest a truth indirectly,
and, without giving us a full and open view of
it, to let us see just so much as will naturally lead
the imagination into all the parts that lie concealed.
This is wonderfully diverting to the understanding,
thus to receive a precept, that enters, as it were,
through a by-way, and to apprehend an idea that
draws a whole train after it. For here the mind,
which is always delighted with its own discoveries,
only takes the hint from the poet, and seems to
work out the rest by the strength of her own faculties.</p>

<p>But, since the inculcating precept upon precept
will at length prove tiresome to the reader, if he
meets with no entertainment,&mdash;the poet must take
care not to encumber his poem with too much
business, but sometimes to relieve the subject with
a moral reflection, or let it rest a while for the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
sake of a pleasant and pertinent digression. Nor is
it sufficient to run out into beautiful and diverting
digressions, (as it is generally thought,) unless they
are brought in aptly, and are something of a piece
with the main design of the Georgic: for they
ought to have a remote alliance at least to the subject,
that so the whole poem may be more uniform
and agreeable in all its parts. We should never
quite lose sight of the country, though we are sometimes
entertained with a distant prospect of it. Of
this nature are Virgil's descriptions of the original
of agriculture, of the fruitfulness of Italy, of a
country life, and the like, which are not brought
in by force, but naturally rise out of the principal
argument and design of the poem. I know no one
digression in the Georgics that may seem to contradict
this observation, besides that in the latter
end of the first book, where the poet launches out
into a discourse of the battle of Pharsalia, and the
actions of Augustus: but it is worth while to consider
how admirably he has turned the course of his
narration into its proper channel, and made his
husbandman concerned even in what relates to the
battle, in those inimitable lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Scilicet et tempus veniet, cum finibus illis</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Agricola, incurvo terram molitus aratro,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Exesa inveniet scabr&acirc; rubigine pila,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Aut gravibus rastris galeas pulsabit inanes,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Grandiaque effossis mirabitur ossa sepulcris.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And afterwards, speaking of Augustus's actions, he
still remembers, that agriculture ought to be some
way hinted at throughout the whole poem:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">----<i>Non ullus aratro</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Dignus honos: squalent abductis arva colonis;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Et curv&aelig; rigidum falces conflantur in ensem.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>We now come to the style which is proper to a
Georgic; and indeed this is the part on which the
poet must lay out all his strength, that his words
may be warm and glowing, and that every thing he
describes may immediately present itself, and rise
up to the reader's view. He ought, in particular, to
be careful of not letting his subject debase his style,
and betray him into a meanness of expression, but
every where to keep up his verse in all the pomp of
numbers, and dignity of words.</p>

<p>I think nothing, which is a phrase or saying in
common talk, should be admitted into a serious
poem; because it takes off from the solemnity of
the expression, and gives it too great a turn of familiarity.
Much less ought the low phrases and
terms of art, that are adapted to husbandry, have
any place in such a work as the Georgic, which is
not to appear in the natural simplicity and nakedness
of its subject, but in the pleasantest dress that
poetry can bestow on it. Thus Virgil, to deviate
from the common form of words, would not make
use of <i>tempore</i>, but <i>sidere</i>, in his first verse, and
every where else abounds with metaphors, Grecisms,
and circumlocutions, to give his verse the greater
pomp, and preserve it from sinking into a plebeian
style. And herein consists Virgil's master-piece,
who has not only excelled all other poets, but even
himself, in the language of his Georgics, where we
receive more strong and lively ideas of things from
his words, than we could have done from the objects
themselves; and find our imaginations more
affected by his descriptions, than they would have
been by the very sight of what he describes.</p>

<p>I shall now, after this short scheme of rules, consider
the different success that Hesiod and Virgil
have met with in this kind of poetry, which may
give us some further notion of the excellence of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Georgics. To begin with Hesiod:&mdash;If we may guess
at his character from his writings, he had much more
of the husbandman than the poet in his temper: he
was wonderfully grave, discreet, and frugal: he lived
altogether in the country, and was probably, for his
great prudence, the oracle of the neighbourhood.&mdash;These
principles of good husbandry ran through his
works, and directed him to the choice of tillage and
merchandize, for the subject of that which is the
most celebrated of them. He is every where bent
on instruction, avoids all manner of digressions,
and does not stir out of the field once in the whole
Georgic. His method, in describing month after
month, with its proper seasons and employments, is
too grave and simple; it takes off from the surprise
and variety of the poem, and makes the whole look
but like a modern almanack in verse. The reader is
carried through a course of weather, and may beforehand
guess whether he is to meet with snow
or rain, clouds or sunshine, in the next description.
His descriptions, indeed, have abundance of nature
in them; but then it is nature in her simplicity and
undress. Thus, when he speaks of January,&mdash;"The
wild beasts," says he, "run shivering through the
woods, with their heads stooping to the ground,
and their tails clapt between their legs; the goats
and oxen are almost flayed with cold: but it is not
so bad with the sheep, because they have a thick
coat of wool about them. The old men too are bitterly
pinched with the weather: but the young girls
feel nothing of it, who sit at home with their mothers
by a warm fire-side." Thus does the old gentleman
give himself up to a loose kind of tattle rather
than endeavour after a just poetical description.
Nor has he shown more of art or judgment in the
precepts he has given us, which are sown so very
thick, that they clog the poem too much, and are
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
often so minute and full of circumstances, that
they weaken and unnerve his verse. But, after all,
we are beholden to him for the first rough sketch
of a Georgic; where we may still discover something
venerable in the antiqueness of the work:
but, if we would see the design enlarged, the figures
reformed, the colouring laid on, and the
whole piece finished, we must expect it from a
greater master's hand.</p>

<p>Virgil has drawn out the rules of tillage and
planting into two books, which Hesiod has dispatched
in half a one; but has so raised the natural
rudeness and simplicity of his subject with
such a significancy of expression, such a pomp of
verse, such variety of transitions, and such a solemn
air in his reflections, that, if we look on both
poets together, we see in one the plainness of a
downright countryman, and, in the other, something
of a rustic majesty, like that of a Roman dictator
at the plough-tail. He delivers the meanest
of his precepts with a kind of grandeur: he breaks
the clods, and tosses the dung about, with an air
of gracefulness. His prognostications of the weather
are taken out of Aratus, where we may see
how judiciously he has picked out those that are
most proper for his husbandman's observation; how
he has enforced the expression, and heightened the
images, which he found in the original.</p>

<p>The Second Book has more wit in it, and a greater
boldness in its metaphors, than any of the rest. The
poet, with a great beauty, applies oblivion, ignorance,
wonder, desire, and the like, to his trees.&mdash;The
last Georgic has, indeed, as many metaphors,
but not so daring as this; for human thoughts and
passions may be more naturally ascribed to a bee,
than to an inanimate plant. He who reads over
the pleasures of a country life, as they are described
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
by Virgil in the latter end of this book, can scarce
be of Virgil's mind in preferring even the life of a
philosopher to it.</p>

<p>We may, I think, read the poet's clime in his description;
for he seems to have been in a sweat at
the writing of it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">----<i>O! qui me gelidis in vallibus H&aelig;mi</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sistat, et ingenti ramorum protegat umbr&acirc;!</i>&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and is every where mentioning, among his chief
pleasures, the coolness of his shades and rivers,
vales and grottoes, which a more northern poet
would have omitted for the description of a sunny
hill, and fire-side.</p>

<p>The Third Georgic seems to be the most laboured
of them all: there is a wonderful vigour and spirit
in the description of the horse and chariot-race.
The force of love is represented in noble instances,
and very sublime expressions. The Scythian winter-piece
appears so very cold and bleak to the eye,
that a man can scarce look on it without shivering.
The murrain, at the end, has all the expressiveness
that words can give. It was here that the poet
strained hard to out-do Lucretius in the description
of his plague: and, if the reader would see what
success he had, he may find it at large in Scaliger.</p>

<p>But Virgil seems no where so well pleased, as
when he is got among his Bees in the Fourth Georgic;
and ennobles the actions of so trivial a creature,
with metaphors drawn from the most important
concerns of mankind. His verses are not in a
greater noise and hurry in the battles of &AElig;neas and
Turnus, than in the engagement of two swarms.
And as, in his &AElig;ne&iuml;s, he compares the labours of
his Trojans to those of bees and pismires, here he
compares the labours of the bees to those of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Cyclops. In short, the last Georgic was a good
prelude to the &AElig;ne&iuml;s, and very well showed what
the poet could do in the description of what was
really great, by his describing the mock grandeur
of an insect with so good a grace. There is more
pleasantness in the little platform of a garden,
which he gives us about the middle of this book,
than in all the spacious walks and water-works of
Rapin. The speech of Proteus, at the end, can never
be enough admired, and was indeed very fit to
conclude so divine a work.</p>

<p>After this particular account of the beauties in
the Georgics, I should, in the next place, endeavour
to point out its imperfections, if it has any. But,
though I think there are some few parts in it that
are not so beautiful as the rest, I shall not presume
to name them, as rather suspecting my own judgement,
than I can believe a fault to be in that poem,
which lay so long under Virgil's correction, and had
his last hand put to it. The First Georgic was probably
burlesqued in the author's life-time; for we
still find in the scholiasts a verse that ridicules part
of a line translated from Hesiod&mdash;<i>Nudus ara, sere
nudus</i>: And we may easily guess at the judgment
of this extraordinary critic, whoever he was, from
his censuring this particular precept. We may be
sure Virgil would not have translated it from Hesiod,
had he not discovered some beauty in it; and
indeed the beauty of it is, what I have before observed
to be frequently met with in Virgil, the delivering
the precept so indirectly, and singling out
the particular circumstance of sowing and ploughing
naked, to suggest to us, that these employments
are proper only in the hot season of the year.</p>

<p class="pmb3">I shall not here compare the style of the Georgics
with that of Lucretius, (which the reader may
see already done in the preface to the second volume
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
of Miscellany Poems,) but shall conclude this
poem to be the most complete, elaborate, and finished
piece of all antiquity. The &AElig;ne&iuml;s, indeed,
is of a nobler kind; but the Georgic is more perfect
in its kind. The &AElig;ne&iuml;s has a greater variety
of beauties in it; but those of the Georgic are more
exquisite. In short, the Georgic has all the perfection
that can be expected in a poem written by
the greatest poet in the flower of his age, when his
invention was ready, his imagination warm, his
judgment settled, and all his faculties in their full
vigour and maturity.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p class="pmb3"><a id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Addison had already distinguished himself as a man of letters,
and as an admirer of Dryden, by a copy of verses addressed
to our author, and by a translation of the Fourth Book of the
Georgics, exclusive of the story of Arist&aelig;us. This last performance
is liberally commended by Dryden in the Postscript to Virgil.
The following Essay, which has been much admired for judicious criticism contained in elegant language, was sent by him to
our author, but without permission to prefix the writer's name.
This circumstance led Tickell to throw some reflection on Dryden,
as if he had meant to assume to himself the merit of the composition.
This charge was refuted by Steele, in a letter to Congreve,
prefixed to an edition of the comedy of "The Drummer," in
1722, who proves, that the Essay was the same paper which Dryden
calls the Preface to the Georgics, and which he acknowledges
to have been sent by a friend, whose name he was not at liberty to
make public. See the article <i>Addison</i> in the "Biographia Britannica."</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="ii1 pmb2"><i>The poet, in the beginning of this book, propounds the general design
of each Georgic: and, after a solemn invocation of all the gods,
who are any way related to his subject, he addresses himself, in particular,
to Augustus, whom he compliments with divinity; and, after,
strikes into his business. He shows the different kinds of tillage
proper to different soils; traces out the original of agriculture;
gives a catalogue of the husbandman's tools; specifies the employments
peculiar to each season; describes the changes of the weather,
with the signs in heaven and earth that forbode them; instances
many of the prodigies that happened near the time of Julius C&aelig;sar's
death; and shuts up all with a supplication to the gods for the safety
of Augustus, and the preservation of Rome.</i><a id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>

<span class="i0">But, ere we stir the yet unbroken ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The various course of seasons must be found;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The weather, and the setting of the winds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The culture suiting to the several kinds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of seeds and plants, and what will thrive and rise,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And soft Idume weeps her odorous tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus Pontus sends her beaver-stones from far;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And naked Spaniards temper steel for war:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The surface, and but lightly print the share,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When cold Arcturus rises with the sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest wicked weeds the corn should over-run<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And croaking notes proclaim the settled fair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then round their airy palaces they fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To greet the sun; and, seized with secret joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When storms are over-blown, with food repair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To their forsaken nests, and callow care.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not that I think their breasts with heavenly souls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inspired, as man, who destiny controls;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, with the changeful temper of the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As rains condense, and sunshine rarefies,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When down the steep of heaven he drives the day:<br /></span>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> The poetry of this book is more sublime than any part of
Virgil, if I have any taste. And if ever I have copied his majestic
style, it is here. The compliment he makes Augustus, almost
in the beginning, is ill imitated by his successors, Lucan and Statius.
They dedicated to tyrants; and their flatteries are gross
and fulsome. Virgil's address is both more lofty and more just.
In the three last lines of this Georgic, I think I have discovered a
secret compliment to the emperor, which none of the commentators
have observed. Virgil had just before described the miseries
which Rome had undergone betwixt the triumvirs and the commonwealth
party: in the close of all, he seems to excuse the
crimes committed by his patron C&aelig;sar, as if he were constrained,
against his own temper, to those violent proceedings, by the necessity
of the times in general, but more particularly by his two
partners, Antony and Lepidus,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>They were the head-strong horses, who hurried Octavius, the
trembling charioteer, along, and were deaf to his reclaiming them.
I observe, farther, that the present wars, in which all Europe, and
part of Asia, are engaged at present, are waged in the same places
here described:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<blockquote>
<p class="ii1 pmb2"><i>The subject of the following book is planting: in handling of which
argument, the poet shews all the different methods of raising trees
describes their variety, and gives rules for the management of
each in particular. He then points out the soils in which the several
plants thrive best, and thence takes occasion to run out into
the praises of Italy: after which, he gives some directions for discovering
the nature of every soil, prescribes rules for dressing of
vines, olives, &amp;c. and concludes the Georgic with a panegyric on
a country life</i>.<a id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<span class="i0">Come, strip with me, my god! come drench all o'er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy limbs in must of wine, and drink at every pore.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Some trees their birth to bounteous Nature owe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For some, without the pains of planting, grow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With osiers thus the banks of brooks abound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sprung from the watery genius of the ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the same principles grey willows come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Herculean poplar, and the tender broom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But some, from seeds inclosed in earth, arise;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">These ways of planting Nature did ordain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For trees and shrubs, and all the sylvan reign.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Others there are, by late experience found:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Some cover rooted stalks in deeper mould;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Their sharpened ends in earth their footing place;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the dry poles produce a living race.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some bow their vines, which buried in the plain,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The trees, which of themselves advance in air,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Because the vigour of the native earth<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Yet these, receiving graffs of other kind,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Their wildness lose, and, quitting nature's part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Obey the rules and discipline of art.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The same do trees, that, sprung from barren roots,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In open fields transplanted bear their fruits.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The plant that shoots from seed, a sullen tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At leisure grows, for late posterity;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The generous flavour lost, the fruits decay,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Much labour is required in trees, to tame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their wild disorder, and in ranks reclaim.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well must the ground be digged, and better dressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New soil to make, and meliorate the rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old stakes of olive-trees in plants revive;  <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">The thin-leaved arbute hazel-graffs receives;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And planes huge apples bear, that bore but leaves.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus mastful beech the bristly chesnut bears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wild ash is white with blooming pears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And greedy swine from grafted elms are fed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With falling acorns, that on oaks are bred.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But, when the smoother bole from knots is free,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Nor our Italian vines produce the shape,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or taste, or flavour, of the Lesbian grape.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Thasian vines in richer soils abound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Mareotic grow in barren ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Psythian grape we dry: Lagean juice<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In tender souls of pliant plants produce.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Chuse next a province for thy vineyard's reign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On hills above, or in the lowly plain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If fertile fields or valleys be thy choice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plant thick; for bounteous Bacchus will rejoice<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And let no soldier straggle from his band.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As legions in the field their front display,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So let thy vines in intervals be set,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But not their rural discipline forget;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The lawless troops, which discipline disclaim,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Next, fenced with hedges and deep ditches round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exclude the encroaching cattle from thy ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While yet the tender gems but just appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unable to sustain the uncertain year;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose leaves are not alone foul winter's prey,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For this, the malefactor goat was laid<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And, glad with Bacchus, on the grassy soil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaped o'er the skins of goats besmeared with oil.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To Bacchus therefore let us tune our lays,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thin cakes in chargers, and a guilty goat,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Whose offered entrails shall his crime reproach,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drip their fatness from the hazel broach.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To dress thy vines, new labour is required;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor must the painful husbandman be tired:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For thrice, at least, in compass of the year,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And in that compass all the world contains.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere Saturn's rebel son usurped the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When beasts were only slain for sacrifice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While peaceful Crete enjoyed her ancient lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere sounding hammers forged the inhuman sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere hollow drums were beat, before the breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of brazen trumpets rung the peals of death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The good old god his hunger did assuage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With roots and herbs, and gave the golden age.<br /></span>

excellent Mr Chetwood,) which are printed in one of my Miscellany
Poems, are the greatest ornament of this book: wherein,
for want of sufficient skill in gardening, agriculture, &amp;c. I may
possibly be mistaken in some terms. But, concerning grafting, my
honoured friend Sir William Bowyer has assured me, that Virgil
has shewn more of poetry than skill, at least in relation to our
more northern climates; and that many of our stocks will not receive
such grafts as our poet tells us would bear in Italy. Nature
has conspired with art to make the garden at Denham Court, of
Sir William's own plantation, one of the most delicious spots of
ground in England: it contains not above five acres (just the compass
of Alcino&uuml;s's garden, described in the Odysses:) but Virgil

<p class="center font09 pmb1">ARGUMENT.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="ii1 pmb2"><i>This book begins with the invocation of some rural deities, and a
compliment to Augustus; after which Virgil directs himself to
M&aelig;cenas, and enters on his subject. He lays down rules for the
breeding and management of horses, oxen, sheep, goats, and dogs;
and interweaves several pleasant descriptions of a chariot-race, of
the battle of the bulls, of the force of love, and of the Scythian
winter. In the latter part of the book, he relates the diseases
incident to cattle; and ends with the description of a fatal murrain
that formerly raged among the Alps.</i></p>

<span class="i2">A time will come, when my maturer Muse,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Or to the plough the sturdy bullock breeds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May know, that from the dam the worth of each proceeds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mother cow must wear a lowering look,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sour-headed, strongly necked, to bear the yoke.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her double dew-lap from her chin descends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at her thighs the ponderous burden ends.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long are her sides and large; her limbs are great;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rough are her ears, and broad her horny feet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her colour shining black, but flecked with white;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She tosses from the yoke; provokes the fight:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She rises in her gait, is free from fears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in her face a bull's resemblance bears:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her ample forehead with a star is crowned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with her length of tail she sweeps the ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bull's insult at four she may sustain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, after ten, from nuptial rites refrain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Six seasons use; but then release the cow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unfit for love, and for the labouring plough.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now, while their youth is filled with kindly fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Submit thy females to the lusty sire:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Watch the quick motions of the frisking tail; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then serve their fury with the rushing male, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Indulging pleasure, lest the breed should fail. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">In youth alone, unhappy mortals live;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Discoloured sickness, anxious labours, come,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">'Tis prudence to prevent the entire decay.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Like diligence requires the courser's race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In early choice, and for a longer space.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The colt, that for a stallion is designed, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">By sure presages shews his generous kind: <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of able body, sound of limb and wind, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upright he walks, on pasterns firm and straight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His motions easy; prancing in his gait;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first to lead the way, to tempt the flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To pass the bridge unknown, nor fear the trembling wood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dauntless at empty noises; lofty necked;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sharp-headed, barrel-bellied, broadly backed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brawny his chest, and deep; his colour gray; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For beauty, dappled, or the brightest bay: <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faint white and dun will scarce the rearing pay. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">The fiery courser, when he hears from far<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sprightly trumpets, and the shouts of war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pricks up his ears; and, trembling with delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shifts place, and paws, and hopes the promised fight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On his right shoulder his thick mane reclined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ruffles at speed, and dances in the wind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His horny hoofs are jetty black and round; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His chine is double; starting with a bound <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">He turns the turf, and shakes the solid ground. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fire from his eyes, clouds from his nostrils, flow:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He bears his rider headlong on the foe.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Such was the steed in Grecian poets famed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proud Cyllarus, by Spartan Pollux tamed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such coursers bore to fight the god of Thrace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And such, Achilles, was thy warlike race.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
<span class="i0">In such a shape, grim Saturn did restrain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His heavenly limbs, and flowed with such a mane,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, half-surprised, and fearing to be seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lecher gallopped from his jealous queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ran up the ridges of the rocks amain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with shrill neighings filled the neighbouring plain.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But, worn with years, when dire diseases come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then hide his not ignoble age at home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In peace to enjoy his former palms and pains;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gratefully be kind to his remains.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, when his blood no youthful spirits move,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He languishes and labours in his love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, when the sprightly seed should swiftly come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dribbling he drudges, and defrauds the womb.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain he burns, like hasty stubble-fires,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in himself his former self requires.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His age and courage weigh; nor those alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But note his father's virtues and his own:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Observe, if he disdains to yield the prize,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of loss impatient, proud of victories.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hast thou beheld, when from the goal they start,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The youthful charioteers with heaving heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rush to the race; and, panting, scarcely bear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The extremes of feverish hope and chilling fear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stoop to the reins, and lash with all their force?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flying chariot kindles in the course:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now alow, and now aloft, they fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As borne through air, and seem to touch the sky.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No stop, no stay: but clouds of sand arise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spurned, and cast backward on the followers' eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hindmost blows the foam upon the first:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such is the love of praise, an honourable thirst.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Bold Erichthonius was the first who joined<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Four horses for the rapid race designed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And o'er the dusty wheels presiding sate:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of bits and bridles: taught the steed to bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To run the ring, and trace the mazy round;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To stop, to fly, the rules of war to know;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To obey the rider, and to dare the foe.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To chuse a youthful steed with courage fired,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To breed him, break him, back him, are required<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Experienced masters; and, in sundry ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their labours equal, and alike their praise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, once again, the battered horse beware:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The weak old stallion will deceive thy care.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though famous in his youth for force and speed, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or was of Argos or Epirian breed, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or did from Neptune's race, or from himself, proceed. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">These things premised, when now the nuptial time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Approaches for the stately steed to climb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With food enable him to make his court;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Feed him with herbs, whatever thou canst find,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then water him, and (drinking what he can)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Encourage him to thirst again, with bran.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Instructed thus, produce him to the fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And join in wedlock to the longing mare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, if the sire be faint, or out of case,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He will be copied in his famished race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sink beneath the pleasing task assigned:<br /></span>

<span class="i2">As for the females, with industrious care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take down their mettle; keep them lean and bare:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With scanty measure then supply their food;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, when athirst, restrain them from the flood;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For his soft neck, a supple collar make<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of bending osiers; and (with time and care<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thy flattering method on the youth pursue:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Joined with his school-fellows by two and two,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Sooth him with praise, and make him understand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The loud applauses of his master's hand:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This, from his weaning, let him well be taught;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then betimes in a soft snaffle wrought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before his tender joints with nerves are knit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Untried in arms, and trembling at the bit.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, when to four full springs his years advance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Teach him to run the round, with pride to prance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And (rightly managed) equal time to beat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To turn, to bound in measure, and curvet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let him to this, with easy pains, be brought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seem to labour, when he labours not.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus formed for speed, he challenges the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leaves the Scythian arrow far behind:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He scours along the field, with loosened reins,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And treads so light, he scarcely prints the plains;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like Boreas in his race, when, rushing forth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sweeps the skies, and clears the cloudy north:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The waving harvest bends beneath his blast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The forest shakes, the groves their honours cast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He flies aloft, and with impetuous roar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pursues the foaming surges to the shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus, o'er the Elean plains, thy well-breathed horse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Impels the flying car, and wins the course,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Or in the stall at home his fodder find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far from the charms of that alluring kind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With two fair eyes his mistress burns his breast:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He looks, and languishes, and leaves his rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forsakes his food, and, pining for the lass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is joyless of the grove, and spurns the growing grass.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soft seducer, with enticing looks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bellowing rivals to the fight provokes.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A beauteous heifer in the wood is bred:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stooping warriors, aiming head to head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Engage their clashing horns: with dreadful sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The forest rattles, and the rocks rebound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They fence, they push, and, pushing, loudly roar:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their dewlaps and their sides are bathed in gore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor, when the war is over, is it peace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor will the vanquished bull his claim release;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, feeding in his breast his ancient fires,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cursing fate, from his proud foe retires.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Driven from his native land to foreign grounds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He with a generous rage resents his wounds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His ignominious flight, the victor's boast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, more than both, the loves, which unrevenged he lost.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Often he turns his eyes, and, with a groan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surveys the pleasing kingdoms, once his own:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And therefore to repair his strength he tries, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hardening his limbs with painful exercise, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rough upon the flinty rock he lies. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">On prickly leaves and on sharp herbs he feeds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then to the prelude of a war proceeds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His horns, yet sore, he tries against a tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And meditates his absent enemy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He snuffs the wind; his heels the sand excite; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, when he stands collected in his might, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">He roars, and promises a more successful fight. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, to redeem his honour at a blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He moves his camp, to meet his careless foe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not more with madness, rolling from afar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spumy waves proclaim the watery war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mounting upwards, with a mighty roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">March onwards, and insult the rocky shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They mate the middle region with their height,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fall no less than with a mountain's weight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The waters boil, and, belching, from below<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Black sands, as from a forceful engine, throw.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus every creature, and of every kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The secret joys of sweet coition find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not only man's imperial race, but they<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That wing the liquid air, or swim the sea,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And hunts her lover in his lonely walks.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis then the shapeless bear his den forsakes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In woods and fields a wild destruction makes:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then woe to him, that, in the desert land<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The stallion snuffs the well-known scent afar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And snorts and trembles for the distant mare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor bits nor bridles can his rage restrain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rugged rocks are interposed in vain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He makes his way o'er mountains, and contemns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unruly torrents, and unforded streams.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bristled boar, who feels the pleasing wound,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">About his churning chaps the frothy bubbles rise:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He rubs his sides against a tree; prepares<br /></span>

<span class="i0">What did the youth, when Love's unerring dart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Transfixed his liver, and inflamed his heart?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">About him, and above, the billows broke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sluices of the sky were open spread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rolling thunder rattled o'er his head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The raging tempest called him back in vain,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Nor could his kindred, nor the kindly force<br /></span>

<span class="i0">No, not the dying maid, who must deplore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His floating carcase on the Sestian shore.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For, when her pouting vent declares her pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She tears the harness, and she rends the rein.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this (when Venus gave them rage and power)<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Their master's mangled members they devour,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">They climb the steepy hills, and stem the flood.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When, at the spring's approach, their marrow burns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(For with the spring their genial warmth returns,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mares to cliffs of rugged rocks repair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with wide nostrils snuff the western air:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When (wonderous to relate!) the parent wind,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Nor to the north, nor to the rising sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor southward to the rainy regions, run,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The shepherd knows it well, and calls by name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hippomanes, to note the mother's flame.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And pleased I am, no beaten road to take,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Now, sacred Pales, in a lofty strain<br /></span>

<span class="i0">First, with assiduous care from winter keep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well foddered in the stalls, thy tender sheep:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then spread with straw the bedding of thy fold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fern beneath, to 'fend the bitter cold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That free from gouts thou may'st preserve thy care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clear from scabs, produced by freezing air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next, let thy goats officiously be nursed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And led to living streams, to quench their thirst.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feed them with winter-browze; and, for their lair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A cote, that opens to the south, prepare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where basking in the sun-shine they may lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the short remnants of his heat enjoy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This during winter's drisly reign be done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the new Ram receives the exalted sun.<a id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For hairy goats of equal profit are<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With woolly sheep, and ask an equal care.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis true, the fleece, when drunk with Tyrian juice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is dearly sold; but not for needful use:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the salacious goat increases more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And twice as largely yields her milky store.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The still distended udders never fail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, when they seem exhausted, swell the pail.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime the pastor shears their hoary beards,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And eases of their hair the loaden herds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their cam'lots, warm in tents, the soldier hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shield the shivering mariner from cold.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On shrubs they browze, and, on the bleaky top<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of rugged hills, the thorny bramble crop.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Attended with their bleating kids, they come <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">At night, unasked, and mindful of their home; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And scarce their swelling bags the threshold overcome. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">So much the more thy diligence bestow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In depth of winter, to defend the snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By how much less the tender helpless kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For their own ills, can fit provision find.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then minister the browze with bounteous hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And open let thy stacks all winter stand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, when the western winds with vital power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Call forth the tender grass and budding flower,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, at the last, produce in open air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both flocks; and send them to their summer fare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the sun while Hesperus appears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First let them sip from herbs the pearly tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of morning dews, and after break their fast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On green-sward ground&mdash;a cool and grateful taste.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, when the day's fourth hour has drawn the dews,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sun's sultry heat their thirst renews;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When creaking grashoppers on shrubs complain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then lead them to their watering-troughs again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In summer's heat, some bending valley find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Closed from the sun, but open to the wind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or seek some ancient oak, whose arms extend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In ample breadth, thy cattle to defend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or solitary grove, or gloomy glade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shield them with its venerable shade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more to watering lead; and feed again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the low sun is sinking to the main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When rising Cynthia sheds her silver dews,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the cool evening-breeze the meads renews,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When linnets fill the woods with tuneful sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hollow shores the halcyon's voice rebound.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Why should my Muse enlarge on Libyan swains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their scattered cottages, and ample plains,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where oft the flocks without a leader stray, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">And, feeding, add the length of night to day? <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whole months they wander, grazing as they go;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Such an extent of plains, so vast a space<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And with him all his patrimony bears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His house and household gods, his trade of war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His bow and quiver, and his trusty cur.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus, under heavy arms, the youth of Rome<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their long laborious marches overcome,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cheerly their tedious travels undergo,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pitch their sudden camp before the foe.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Not so the Scythian shepherd tends his fold,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Nor he who treads the bleak M&aelig;otian strand,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">From locks uncombed, and from the frozen beard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long icicles depend, and crackling sounds are heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime perpetual sleet, and driving snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Obscure the skies, and hang on herds below.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The starving cattle perish in their stalls;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Huge oxen stand inclosed in wintery walls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of snow congealed; whole herds are buried there<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The dexterous huntsman wounds not these afar<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And, while they strive in vain to make their way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through hills of snow, and pitifully bray,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And homeward, on his back, the joyful burden bears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The men to subterranean caves retire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secure from cold, and crowd the cheerful fire:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Their jovial nights in frolics and in play<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where skins of beasts the rude barbarians wear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spoils of foxes, and the furry bear.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is wool thy care? Let not thy cattle go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where bushes are, where burs and thistles grow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor in too rank a pasture let them feed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then of the purest white select thy breed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even though a snowy ram thou shalt behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prefer him not in haste for husband to thy fold:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But search his mouth; and, if a swarthy tongue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is underneath his humid palate hung,<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Reject him, lest he darken all the flock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And substitute another from thy stock.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas thus, with fleeces milky white, (if we<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May trust report,) Pan, god of Arcady,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did bribe thee, Cynthia; nor didst thou disdain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When called in woody shades, to cure a lover's pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If milk be thy design, with plenteous hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring clover-grass; and from the marshy land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Salt herbage for the foddering rack provide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fill their bags, and swell the milky tide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These raise their thirst, and to the taste restore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The savour of the salt, on which they fed before.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Some, when the kids their dams too deeply drain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With gags and muzzles their soft mouths restrain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their morning milk the peasants press at night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their evening meal, before the rising light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To market bear; or sparingly they steep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With seasoning salt, and stored for winter keep.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor, last, forget thy faithful dogs; but feed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fattening whey the mastiffs' generous breed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Spartan race, who, for the fold's relief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will prosecute with cries the nightly thief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Repulse the prowling wolf, and hold at bay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mountain robbers rushing to the prey.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With cries of hounds, thou may'st pursue the fear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of flying hares, and chase the fallow deer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rouze from their desert dens the bristled rage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of boars, and beamy stags in toils engage.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With smoke of burning cedar scent thy walls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fume with stinking galbanum thy stalls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With that rank odour from thy dwelling-place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To drive the viper's brood, and all the venomed race:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For often, under stalls unmoved, they lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Obscure in shades, and shunning heaven's broad eye:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And snakes, familiar, to the hearth succeed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disclose their eggs, and near the chimney breed&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Whether to roofy houses they repair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or sun themselves abroad in open air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all abodes, of pestilential kind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sheep and oxen, and the painful hind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take, shepherd, take a plant of stubborn oak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And labour him with many a sturdy stroke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or with hard stones demolish from afar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His haughty crest, the seat of all the war;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Invade his hissing throat, and winding spires;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till, stretched in length, the unfolded foe retires.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He drags his tail, and for his head provides, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in some secret cranny slowly glides; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But leaves exposed to blows his back and battered sides. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">In fair Calabria's woods a snake is bred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With curling crest, and with advancing head:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waving he rolls, and makes a winding track;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His belly spotted, burnished is his back.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While springs are broken, while the southern air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dropping heavens the moistened earth repair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lives on standing lakes and trembling bogs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fills his maw with fish, or with loquacious frogs:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when, in muddy pools, the water sinks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the chapt earth is furrowed o'er with chinks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He leaves the fens, and leaps upon the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, hissing, rolls his glaring eyes around.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With thirst inflamed, impatient of the heats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He rages in the fields, and wide destruction threats.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! let not sleep my closing eyes invade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In open plains, or in the secret shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he, renewed in all the speckled pride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of pompous youth, has cast his slough aside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in his summer livery rolls along, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Erect, and brandishing his forky tongue, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaving his nest, and his imperfect young, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>

<span class="i2">The causes and the signs shall next be told,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of every sickness that infects the fold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A scabby tetter on their pelts will stick,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the raw rain has pierced them to the quick,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or searching frosts have eaten through the skin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or burning icicles are lodged within;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, when the fleece is shorn, if sweat remains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unwashed, and soaks into their empty veins;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When their defenceless limbs the brambles tear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Short of their wool, and naked from the shear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good shepherds, after shearing, drench their sheep: <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their flock's father (forced from high to leap) <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swims down the stream, and plunges in the deep. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">They oint their naked limbs with mothered oil;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, from the founts where living sulphurs boil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They mix a med'cine to foment their limbs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With scum that on the molten silver swims;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fat pitch, and black bitumen, add to these, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besides the waxen labour of the bees, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hellebore, and squills deep-rooted in the seas. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Receipts abound; but, searching all thy store,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The best is still at hand, to lance the sore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cut the head; for, till the core be found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The secret vice is fed, and gathers ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While, making fruitless moan, the shepherd stands, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, when the lancing-knife requires his hands, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vain help, with idle prayers, from heaven demands. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep in their bones when fevers fix their seat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rack their limbs, and lick the vital heat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ready cure to cool the raging pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is underneath the foot to breathe a vein.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This remedy the Scythian shepherds found:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The inhabitants of Thracia's hilly ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Gelons, use it, when for drink and food<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They mix their crudled milk with horses' blood.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
<span class="i2">But, where thou seest a single sheep remain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In shades aloof, or couched upon the plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or listlessly to crop the tender grass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or late to lag behind with truant pace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Revenge the crime, and take the traitor's head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere in the faultless flock the dire contagion spread.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">On winter seas we fewer storms behold,</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than foul diseases that infect the fold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor do those ills on single bodies prey, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But oftener bring the nation to decay, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sweep the present stock and future hope away. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">A dire example of this truth appears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, after such a length of rolling years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We see the naked Alps, and thin remains <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of scattered cots, and yet unpeopled plains, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once filled with grazing flocks, the shepherds' happy reigns. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Here, from the vicious air and sickly skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A plague did on the dumb creation rise:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">During the autumnal heats the infection grew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tame cattle and the beasts of nature slew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poisoning the standing lakes, and pools impure;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor was the foodful grass in fields secure.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strange death! for, when the thirsty fire had drunk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their vital blood, and the dry nerves were shrunk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the contracted limbs were cramped, even then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A waterish humour swelled and oozed again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Converting into bane the kindly juice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ordained by Nature for a better use.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The victim ox, that was for altars prest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trimmed with white ribbons, and with garlands drest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sunk of himself, without the god's command,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Preventing the slow sacrificer's hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, by the holy butcher if he fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The inspected entrails could no fates foretell;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Nor, laid on altars, did pure flames arise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But clouds of smouldering smoke forbade the sacrifice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarcely the knife was reddened with his gore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the black poison stained the sandy floor.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thriven calves in meads their food forsake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And render their sweet souls before the plenteous rack.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fawning dog runs mad; the wheezing swine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With coughs is choked, and labours from the chine:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The victor horse, forgetful of his food,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The palm renounces, and abhors the flood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He paws the ground; and on his hanging ears <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A doubtful sweat in clammy drops appears: <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Parched is his hide, and rugged are his hairs. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such are the symptoms of the young disease;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, in time's process, when his pains increase,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He rolls his mournful eyes; he deeply groans<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With patient sobbing, and with manly moans.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He heaves for breath; which, from his lungs supplied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fetched from far, distends his labouring side.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To his rough palate his dry tongue succeeds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ropy gore he from his nostrils bleeds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A drench of wine has with success been used,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And through a horn the generous juice infused,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, timely taken, op'd his closing jaws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, if too late, the patient's death did cause:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the too vigorous dose too fiercely wrought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And added fury to the strength it brought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Recruited into rage, he grinds his teeth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his own flesh, and feeds approaching death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye gods, to better fate good men dispose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And turn that impious error on our foes!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The steer, who to the yoke was bred to bow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Studious of tillage, and the crooked plough,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Falls down and dies; and, dying, spews a flood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of foamy madness, mixed with clotted blood.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The clown, who, cursing Providence, repines,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His mournful fellow from the team disjoins;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With many a groan forsakes his fruitless care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the unfinished furrow leaves the share.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pining steer, no shades of lofty woods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor flowery meads, can ease, nor crystal floods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rolled from the rock: his flabby flanks decrease;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His eyes are settled in a stupid peace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His bulk too weighty for his thighs is grown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his unwieldy neck hangs drooping down.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now what avails his well-deserving toil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To turn the glebe, or smooth the rugged soil?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet he never supped in solemn state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Nor undigested feasts did urge his fate,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor day to night luxuriously did join,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor surfeited on rich Campanian wine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Simple his beverage, homely was his food,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wholesome herbage, and the running flood:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No dreadful dreams awaked him with affright;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His pains by day secured his rest by night.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Twas then that buffaloes, ill paired, were seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To draw the car of Jove's imperial queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For want of oxen; and the labouring swain <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scratched, with a rake, a furrow for his grain, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And covered with his hand the shallow seed again. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">He yokes himself, and up the hilly height,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">The nightly wolf, that round the enclosure prowled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To leap the fence, now plots not on the fold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tamed with a sharper pain. The fearful doe, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flying stag, amidst the greyhounds go, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And round the dwellings roam of man, their fiercer foe. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The scaly nations of the sea profound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like shipwrecked carcases, are driven aground,<br /></span>

<p class="center font09 pmb1">ARGUMENT.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="ii1 pmb2"><i>Virgil has taken care to raise the subject of each Georgic. In the
first, he has only dead matter on which to work. In the second,
he just steps on the world of life, and describes that degree of it
which is to be found in vegetables. In the third, he advances to
animals: and, in the last, he singles out the Bee, which may be
reckoned the most sagacious of them, for his subject.</i></p>

<p class="ii1 pmb2"><i>In this Georgic, he shews us what station is most proper for the
bees, and when they begin to gather honey; how to call them
home when they swarm; and how to part them when they are engaged
in battle. From hence he takes occasion to discover their
different kinds; and, after an excursion, relates their prudent and
politic administration of affairs, and the several diseases that often
rage in their hives, with the proper symptoms and remedies
of each disease. In the last place, he lays down a method of repairing
their kind, supposing their whole breed lost; and gives at
large the history of its invention.</i></p>

<span class="i0">That, when the youthful prince,<a id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> with proud alarm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calls out the venturous colony to swarm&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When first their way through yielding air they wing,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The banks of brooks may make a cool retreat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the raw soldiers from the scalding heat,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">They skim the floods, and sip the purple flowers.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Their young succession all their cares employ:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Straight to their ancient cells, recalled from air,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The nimble horsemen scour the fields of air;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In form of battle drawn, they issue forth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every knight is proud to prove his worth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prest for their country's honour, and their king's, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">On their sharp beaks they whet their pointed stings, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And exercise their arms, and tremble with their wings. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full in the midst the haughty monarchs ride; <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">One monarch wears an honest open face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shaped to his size, and godlike to behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His royal body shines with specks of gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ruddy scales; for empire he designed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is better born, and of a nobler kind.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The better brood, unlike the bastard crew,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The task is easy&mdash;but to clip the wings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of their high-flying arbitrary kings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At their command, the people swarm away:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For, where with stately towers Tarentum stands,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I chanced an old Corycian swain to know, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lord of few acres, and those barren too, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unfit for sheep or vines, and more unfit to sow; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, labouring well his little spot of ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some scattering pot-herbs here and there he found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, cultivated with his daily care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bruised with vervain, were his frugal fare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes white lilies did their leaves afford,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With wholsome poppy-flowers, to mend his homely board;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, late returning home, he supped at ease, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wisely deemed the wealth of monarchs less; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The little of his own, because his own, did please. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To quit his care, he gathered, first of all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In spring the roses, apples in the fall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, when cold winter split the rocks in twain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ice the running rivers did restrain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He stripped the bear's-foot of its leafy growth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, calling western winds, accused the spring of sloth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He therefore first among the swains was found <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To reap the product of his laboured ground, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And squeeze the combs with golden liquor crowned. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His limes were first in flowers; his lofty pines,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With friendly shade, secured his tender vines.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For every bloom his trees in spring afford,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An autumn apple was by tale restored.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He knew to rank his elms in even rows, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For fruit the grafted pear-tree to dispose, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tame to plums the sourness of the sloes. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With spreading planes he made a cool retreat,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Each has a certain home, a several stall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All is the state's, the state provides for all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mindful of coming cold, they share the pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hoard, for winter's use, the summer's gain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some o'er the public magazines preside,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To pitch the waxen flooring some contrive;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some nurse the future nation of the hive;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweet honey some condense; some purge the grout;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rest, in cells apart, the liquid nectar shut:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All, with united force, combine to drive<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lazy drones from the laborious hive:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With envy stung, they view each other's deeds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With diligence the fragrant work proceeds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As, when the Cyclops, at the almighty nod,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New thunder hasten for their angry god,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Subdued in fire the stubborn metal lies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One brawny smith the puffing bellows plies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And draws and blows reciprocating air:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Others to quench the hissing mass prepare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With lifted arms they order every blow, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And chime their sounding hammers in a row; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With laboured anvils &AElig;tna groans below. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strongly they strike; huge flakes of flames expire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tongs they turn the steel, and vex it in the fire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If little things with great we may compare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such are the bees, and such their busy care;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Studious of honey, each in his degree,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To fortify the combs, to build the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To prop the ruins, lest the fabric fall:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, late at night, with weary pinions come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The labouring youth, and heavy laden, home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plains, meads, and orchards, all the day he plies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gleans of yellow thyme distend his thighs:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He spoils the saffron flowers; he sips the blues<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of violets, wilding blooms, and willow dews.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their toil is common, common is their sleep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They shake their wings when morn begins to peep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rush through the city-gates without delay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor ends their work, but with declining day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, having spent the last remains of light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They give their bodies due repose at night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When hollow murmurs of their evening bells<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dismiss the sleepy swains, and toll them to their cells.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When once in beds their weary limbs they steep,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">'Tis sacred silence all. Nor dare they stray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When rain is promised, or a stormy day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But near the city walls their watering take,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor forage far, but short excursions make.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And as, when empty barks on billows float,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sandy ballast sailors trim the boat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So bees bear gravel-stones, whose poising weight<br /></span>

<span class="i2">But (what's more strange) their modest appetites,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Averse from Venus, fly the nuptial rites.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No lust enervates their heroic mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor wastes their strength on wanton womankind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in their mouths reside their genial powers:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They gather children from the leaves and flowers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus make they kings to fill the regal seat, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus their little citizens create, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Hence take the forms his prescience did ordain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And into him at length resolve again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No room is left for death: they mount the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to their own congenial planets fly.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now, when thou hast decreed to seize their stores,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by prerogative to break their doors,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sprinkled water first the city choke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then pursue the citizens with smoke.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two honey-harvests fall in every year:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First, when the pleasing Pleiades appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, springing upward, spurn the briny seas:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With a black train of storms, and winter wind, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">They plunge into the deep, and safe protection find. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prone to revenge, the bees, a wrathful race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When once provoked, assault the aggressor's face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And through the purple veins a passage find;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There fix their stings, and leave their souls behind.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And would'st preserve thy famished family;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fragrant thyme the city fumigate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And break the waxen walls to save the state.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Or spiders in the vault their snary webs have spread.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The more oppressed by foes, or famine-pined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The more increase thy care to save the sinking kind:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With greens and flowers recruit their empty hives,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seek fresh forage to sustain their lives.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But, since they share with man one common fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In health and sickness, and in turns of state,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Observe the symptoms. When they fall away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And languish with insensible decay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They change their hue; with haggard eyes they stare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lean are their looks, and shagged is their hair:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And crowds of dead, that never must return <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To their loved hives, in decent pomp are borne: <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their friends attend the hearse; the next relations mourn. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sick, for air, before the portal gasp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their feeble legs within each other clasp,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or idle in their empty hives remain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Benumbed with cold, and listless of their gain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soft whispers then, and broken sounds, are heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when the woods by gentle winds are stirred;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such stifled noise as the close furnace hides,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or dying murmurs of departing tides.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This when thou seest, galbanean odours use,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And honey in the sickly hive infuse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through reeden pipes convey the golden flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To invite the people to their wonted food.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mix it with thickened juice of sodden wines,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And raisins from the grapes of Psythian vines:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To these add pounded galls, and roses dry,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">A flower there is, that grows in meadow-ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amellus called, and easy to be found;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, from one root, the rising stem bestows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wood of leaves, and violet-purple boughs:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flower itself is glorious to behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shines on altars like refulgent gold&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sharp to the taste&mdash;by shepherds near the stream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Mella found; and thence they gave the name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Boil this restoring root in generous wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And set beside the door, the sickly stock to dine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, if the labouring kind be wholly lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not to be retrieved with care or cost;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis time to touch the precepts of an art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Arcadian master did of old impart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how he stocked his empty hives again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Renewed with putrid gore of oxen slain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An ancient legend I prepare to sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And upward follow Fame's immortal spring:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For, where with seven-fold horns mysterious Nile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surrounds the skirts of Egypt's fruitful isle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where in pomp the sun-burnt people ride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On painted barges, o'er the teeming tide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, pouring down from Ethiopian lands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Makes green the soil with slime, and black prolific sands&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That length of region, and large tract of ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this one art a sure relief have found.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First, in a place by nature close, they build<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A narrow flooring, guttered, walled, and tiled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this, four windows are contrived, that strike,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the four winds opposed, their beams oblique.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A steer of two years old they take, whose head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now first with burnished horns begins to spread:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They stop his nostrils, while he strives in vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To breathe free air, and struggles with his pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knocked down, he dies: his bowels, bruised within,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betray no wound on his unbroken skin.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Extended thus, in this obscene abode<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They leave the beast; but first sweet flowers are strowed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath his body, broken boughs and thyme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pleasing cassia just renewed in prime.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This must be done, ere spring makes equal day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When western winds on curling waters play;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere painted meads produce their flowery crops,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or swallows twitter on the chimney-tops.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tainted blood, in this close prison pent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Begins to boil, and through the bones ferment.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then (wonderous to behold) new creatures rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A moving mass at first, and short of thighs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Till, shooting out with legs, and imp'd with wings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The grubs proceed to bees with pointed stings;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, more and more affecting air, they try<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their tender pinions, and begin to fly:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length, like summer storms from spreading clouds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That burst at once, and pour impetuous floods&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or flights of arrows from the Parthian bows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When from afar they gall embattled foes&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With such a tempest through the skies they steer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And such a form the winged squadrons bear.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What god, O Muse! this useful science taught?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or by what man's experience was it brought?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sad Arist&aelig;us from fair Tempe fled&mdash; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His bees with famine or diseases dead:&mdash; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">And, while his falling tears the stream supplied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus, mourning, to his mother goddess cried:&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Is in the depth of this immortal flood!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What boots it, that from Ph&oelig;bus' loins I spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The third, by him and thee, from heaven's high king?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And promise of the skies to thy deluded son?<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Why didst thou me, unhappy me, create,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Odious to gods, and born to bitter fate?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom scarce my sheep, and scarce my painful plough, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The needful aids of human life allow: <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">So wretched is thy son, so hard a mother thou! <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proceed, inhuman parent, in thy scorn; <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Root up my trees; with blights destroy my corn; <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">My vineyards ruin, and my sheepfolds burn. <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let loose thy rage; let all thy spite be shown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since thus thy hate pursues the praises of thy son."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, from her mossy bower below the ground, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His careful mother heard the plaintive sound&mdash; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Encompassed with her sea-green sisters round.<a id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">One common work they plied; their distaffs full<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With carded locks of blue Milesian wool.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spio, with Drymo brown, and Xantho fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sweet Phyllodoce with long dishevelled hair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cydippe with Lycorias, one a maid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one that once had called Lucina's aid;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clio and Bero&euml;, from one father both;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both girt with gold, and clad in party-coloured cloth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Opis the meek, and Deiopeia proud;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nis&aelig;a lofty, with Ligea loud;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thalia joyous, Ephyre the sad, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Arethusa, once Diana's maid, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now (her quiver left) to love betrayed. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To these Clymene the sweet theft declares<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Mars; and Vulcan's unavailing cares;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the rapes of gods, and every love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From ancient Chaos down to youthful Jove.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus while she sings, the sisters turn the wheel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Empty the woolly rock, and fill the reel.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mournful sound again the mother hears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again the mournful sound invades the sisters' ears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Starting at once from their green seats, they rise&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fear in their heart, amazement in their eyes.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But Arethusa, leaping from her bed, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">First lifts above the waves her beauteous head, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, crying from afar, thus to Cyrene said:&mdash; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O sister, not with causeless fear possest!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No stranger voice disturbs thy tender breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis Arist&aelig;us, 'tis thy darling son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who to his careless mother makes his moan.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With downcast eyes, wet cheeks, and folded hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upbraiding heaven from whence his lineage came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cruel calls the gods, and cruel thee, by name."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Cyrene, moved with love, and seized with fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cries out,&mdash;"Conduct my son, conduct him here:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To view the secrets of our deep abodes."<br /></span>

<span class="i0">At once the ranks of swelling streams divide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two rising heaps of liquid crystal stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leave a space betwixt of empty sand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus safe received, the downward track he treads,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which to his mother's watery palace leads.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With wondering eyes he views the secret store<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of lakes, that pent in hollow caverns, roar;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He hears the crackling sounds of coral woods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sees the secret source of subterranean floods;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where, distinguished in their several cells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fount of Phasis, and of Lycus, dwells;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where swift Enipeus in his bed appears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Tyber his majestic forehead rears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whence Anio flows, and Hypanis profound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breaks through the opposing rocks with raging sound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Po first issues from his dark abodes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, awful in his cradle, rules the floods:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two golden horns on his large front he wears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his grim face a bull's resemblance bears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With rapid course he seeks the sacred main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fattens, as he runs, the fruitful plain.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Now, to the court arrived, the admiring son<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beholds the vaulted roofs of pory stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now to his mother goddess tells his grief,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The officious nymphs, attending in a ring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With waters drawn from their perpetual spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From earthly dregs his body purify,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And honour with full bowls their friendly guest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sacred altars are involved in smoke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the bright choir their kindred gods invoke.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two bowls the mother fills with Lydian wine; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then thus: "Let these be poured, with rites divine, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the great authors of our watery line&mdash; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>

<span class="i2">Within a mountain's hollow womb, there lies<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And there, like centries set, without the mouth abide: <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A station safe for ships, when tempests roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A silent harbour, and a covered shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secure within resides the various god,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And, darting to the bottom, baked the mud;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When weary Proteus, from the briny waves,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When, rushing on with shouts, he binds in chains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The drowzy prophet, and his limbs constrains.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then roaring beasts, and running streams, he tries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wearies all his miracles of lies:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, having shifted every form to 'scape,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Audacious youth! what madness could provoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mortal man to invade a sleeping god?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What business brought thee to my dark abode?"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To this, the audacious youth:&mdash;"Thou know'st full well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My name and business, god; nor need I tell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No man can Proteus cheat: but, Proteus, leave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy fraudful arts, and do not thou deceive.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Following the gods' command, I come to implore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy help, my perished people to restore."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The seer, who could not yet his wrath assuage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rolled his green eyes, that sparkled with his rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gnashed his teeth, and cried,&mdash;"No vulgar god<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pursues thy crimes, nor with a common rod.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For crimes, not his, the lover lost his life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at thy hands requires his murdered wife:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor (if the Fates assist not) canst thou 'scape<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The just revenge of that intended rape.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shun thy lawless lust, the dying bride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unwary, took along the river's side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor at her heels perceived the deadly snake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That kept the bank, in covert of the brake.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all her fellow nymphs the mountains tear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With loud laments, and break the yielding air:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The realms of Mars remurmur all around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And echoes to the Athenian shores rebound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The unhappy husband, husband now no more, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did on his tuneful harp his loss deplore, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">He called, sighed, sung: his griefs with day begun, <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor were they finished with the setting sun. <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even to the dark dominions of the night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He took his way, through forests void of light,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He first; and close behind him followed she;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For such was Proserpine's severe decree&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When strong desires the impatient youth invade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By little caution and much love betrayed:<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
<span class="i0">A fault, which easy pardon might receive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were lovers judges, or could hell forgive:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, near the confines of etherial light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And longing for the glimmering of a sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The unwary lover cast his eyes behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forgetful of the law, nor master of his mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straight all his hopes exhaled in empty smoke,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Three flashes of blue lightning gave the sign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of covenants broke; three peals of thunder join.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then thus the bride:&mdash;'What fury seized on thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unhappy man! to lose thyself and me?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dragged back again by cruel destinies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An iron slumber shuts my swimming eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now, farewell! Involved in shades of night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ever I am ravished from thy sight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain I reach my feeble hands, to join<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sweet embraces&mdash;ah! no longer thine!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She said; and from his eyes the fleeting fair <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Retired like subtile smoke dissolved in air, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left her hopeless lover in despair. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain, with folding arms, the youth essayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To stop her flight, and strain the flying shade:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With rage inflamed, astonished with surprise; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she returned no more, to bless his longing eyes. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor would the infernal ferry-man once more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be bribed to waft him to the farther shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What should he do, who twice had lost his love?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What notes invent? what new petitions move?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her soul already was consigned to Fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shivering in the leaky sculler sate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For seven continued months, if Fame say true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wretched swain his sorrows did renew:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Trees bent their heads to hear him sing his wrongs:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fierce tigers couched around, and lolled their fawning tongues.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, close in poplar shades, her children gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mother nightingale laments alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose nest some prying churl had found, and thence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By stealth, conveyed the unfeathered innocence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she supplies the night with mournful strains;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And melancholy music fills the plains.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sad Orpheus thus his tedious hours employs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Averse from Venus, and from nuptial joys.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone he tempts the frozen floods, alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The unhappy climes, where spring was never known:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He mourned his wretched wife, in vain restored,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Pluto's unavailing boon deplored.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Thracian matrons&mdash;who the youth accused<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of love disdained, and marriage rites refused&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With furies and nocturnal orgies fired,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length against his sacred life conspired.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom even the savage beasts had spared, they killed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strewed his mangled limbs about the field.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, when his head, from his fair shoulders torn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Washed by the waters, was on Hebrus borne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even then his trembling tongue invoked his bride; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>

<span class="i2">This answer Proteus gave; nor more he said <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in the billows plunged his hoary head; <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, where he leaped, the waves in circles widely spread. <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">The nymph returned, her drooping son to cheer,<br /></span>

<p class="pmb3">My most ingenious friend, Sir Henry Shere, has observed,
through a glass-hive, that the young prince of the bees, or heir
presumptive of the crown, approaches the king's apartment with
great reverence; and, for three successive mornings, demands permission
to lead forth a colony of that year's bees. If his petition
be granted, (which he seems to make by humble hummings,) the
swarm arises under his conduct. If the answer be, <i>le roi s'avisera</i>,&mdash;that
is, if the old monarch think it not convenient for the
public good to part with so many of his subjects, the next morning
the prince is found dead before the threshold of the palace.</p>

<p class="pmb3">The Episode of Orpheus and Eurydice begins here, and contains
the only machine which Virgil uses in the "Georgics." I
have observed, in the epistle before the &AElig;ne&iuml;s, that our author
seldom employs machines but to adorn his poem, and that the action
which they seemingly perform, is really produced without
them. Of this nature is the legend of the bees restored by miracle;
when the receipt, which the poet gives, would do the work
without one. The only beautiful machine which I remember in
the modern poets, is in Ariosto, where God commands St Michael
to take care, that Paris, then besieged by the Saracens, should be
succoured by Rinaldo. In order to do this, he enjoins the archangel
to find Silence and Discord; the first to conduct the Christian
army to relieve the town, with so much secrecy, that their march
should not be discovered; the latter to enter the camp of the infidels,
and there to sow dissention among the principal commanders.
The heavenly messenger takes his way to an ancient monastery;
not doubting there to find Silence in her primitive abode;
but, instead of Silence finds Discord: the monks, being divided
into factions about the choice of some new officer, were at <i>snic</i>
and <i>snee</i> with their drawn knives. The satire needs no explanation.
And here it may be also observed, that ambition, jealousy,
and worldly interest, and point of honour, had made variance
both in the cloister and the camp; and strict discipline had
done the work of Silence, in conducting the Christian army to surprise
the Turks.</p>

<span class="font08">KNIGHT OF THE MOST NOBLE ORDER OF THE GARTER.</span></h2>


<p>A heroic poem, truly such, is undoubtedly the
greatest work which the soul of man is capable to
perform. The design of it is to form the mind to
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
heroic virtue by example. It is conveyed in verse,
that it may delight, while it instructs: the action
of it is always one, entire, and great. The least
and most trivial episodes, or under-actions, which
are interwoven in it, are parts either necessary or
convenient to carry on the main design; either so
necessary, that, without them, the poem must be
imperfect, or so convenient, that no others can be
imagined more suitable to the place in which they
are. There is nothing to be left void in a firm
building; even the cavities ought not to be filled
with rubbish, (which is of a perishable kind, destructive
to the strength,) but with brick or stone,
though of less pieces, yet of the same nature, and
fitted to the crannies. Even the least portions of
them must be of the epic kind: all things must be
grave, majestical, and sublime; nothing of a foreign
nature, like the trifling <i>novels</i>, which Ariosto,<a id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and
others, have inserted in their poems; by which the
reader is misled into another sort of pleasure, opposite
to that which is designed in an epic poem.
One raises the soul, and hardens it to virtue; the
other softens it again, and unbends it into vice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>One conduces to the poet's aim, the completing of
his work, which he is driving on, labouring and
hastening in every line; the other slackens his
pace, diverts him from his way, and locks him up,
like a knight-errant, in an enchanted castle, when
he should be pursuing his first adventure. Statius,
as Bossu has well observed, was ambitious of trying
his strength with his master Virgil, as Virgil
had before tried his with Homer. The Grecian
gave the two Romans an example, in the games
which were celebrated at the funerals of Patroclus.
Virgil imitated the invention of Homer, but changed
the sports. But both the Greek and Latin poet
took their occasions from the subject; though, to
confess the truth, they were both ornamental, or,
at best, convenient parts of it, rather than of necessity
arising from it. Statius, who, through his
whole poem, is noted for want of conduct and
judgment, instead of staying, as he might have
done, for the death of Capaneus, Hippomedon, Tydeus,
or some other of his seven champions, (who
are heroes all alike,) or more properly for the tragical
end of the two brothers, whose exequies the
next successor had leisure to perform when the
siege was raised, and in the interval betwixt the
poet's first action and his second&mdash;went out of his
way, as it were on prepense malice, to commit a
fault. For he took his opportunity to kill a royal
infant by the means of a serpent, (that author of
all evil,) to make way for those funeral honours
which he intended for him. Now, if this innocent
had been of any relation to his Theba&iuml;s&mdash;if he had
either furthered or hindered the taking of the town&mdash;the
poet might have found some sorry excuse at
least, for detaining the reader from the promised
siege. On these terms, this Capaneus of a poet
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
engaged his two immortal predecessors; and his
success was answerable to his enterprise.<a id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>If this &oelig;conomy must be observed in the minutest
parts of an epic poem, which, to a common
reader, seem to be detached from the body, and almost
independent of it; what soul, though sent
into the world with great advantages of nature,
cultivated with the liberal arts and sciences, conversant
with histories of the dead, and enriched
with observations on the living, can be sufficient
to inform the whole body of so great a work? I
touch here but transiently, without any strict method,
on some few of those many rules of imitating
nature, which Aristotle drew from Homer's
Iliads and Odysseys, and which he fitted to the
drama; furnishing himself also with observations
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
from the practice of the theatre, when it flourished
under &AElig;schylus, Euripides, and Sophocles: for
the original of the stage was from the epic poem.
Narration, doubtless, preceded acting, and gave
laws to it: what at first was told artfully, was, in
process of time, represented gracefully to the sight
and hearing. Those episodes of Homer, which
were proper for the stage, the poets amplified each
into an action; out of his limbs they formed their
bodies; what he had contracted, they enlarged;
out of one Hercules, were made infinity of pygmies,
yet all endued with human souls; for from
him, their great creator, they have each of them
the <i>divin&aelig; particulam aur&aelig;</i>. They flowed from him
at first, and are at last resolved into him. Nor
were they only animated by him, but their measure
and symmetry was owing to him. His one,
entire, and great action, was copied by them according
to the proportions of the drama. If he finished
his orb within the year, it sufficed to teach
them, that their action being less, and being also
less diversified with incidents, their orb, of consequence,
must be circumscribed in a less compass,
which they reduced within the limits either of a
natural or an artificial day; so that, as he taught
them to amplify what he had shortened, by the
same rule, applied the contrary way, he taught
them to shorten what he had amplified. Tragedy
is the miniature of human life; an epic poem is
the draught at length.<a id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Here, my lord, I must
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
contract also; for, before I was aware, I was almost
running into a long digression, to prove, that
there is no such absolute necessity that the time of
a stage action should so strictly be confined to
twenty-four hours, as never to exceed them, for
which Aristotle contends, and the Grecian stage
has practised. Some longer space, on some occasions,
I think, may be allowed, especially for the
English theatre, which requires more variety of incidents
than the French. Corneille himself, after
long practice, was inclined to think, that the time
allotted by the ancients was too short to raise and
finish a great action: and better a mechanic rule
were stretched or broken, than a great beauty were
omitted. To raise, and afterwards to calm the passions&mdash;to
purge the soul from pride, by the examples
of human miseries, which befal the greatest&mdash;in
few words, to expel arrogance, and introduce
compassion, are the great effects of tragedy; great,
I must confess, if they were altogether as true as
they are pompous. But are habits to be introduced
at three hours' warning? are radical diseases so
suddenly removed? A mountebank may promise
such a cure, but a skilful physician will not undertake
it. An epic poem is not in so much haste: it
works leisurely; the changes which it makes are
slow; but the cure is likely to be more perfect.
The effects of tragedy, as I said, are too violent
to be lasting. If it be answered, that, for this reason,
tragedies are often to be seen, and the dose to
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
be repeated, this is tacitly to confess, that there is
more virtue in one heroic poem, than in many tragedies.
A man is humbled one day, and his pride
returns the next. Chemical medicines are observed
to relieve oftener than to cure: for it is the
nature of spirits to make swift impressions, but not
deep. Galenical decoctions, to which I may properly
compare an epic poem, have more of body in
them; they work by their substance and their
weight. It is one reason of Aristotle's to prove,
that tragedy is the more noble, because it turns in
a shorter compass; the whole action being circumscribed
within the space of four-and-twenty hours.
He might prove as well, that a mushroom is to be
preferred before a peach, because it shoots up in
the compass of a night. A chariot may be driven
round the pillar in less space than a large machine,
because the bulk is not so great. Is the Moon a
more noble planet than Saturn, because she makes
her revolution in less than thirty days, and he in
little less than thirty years? Both their orbs are in
proportion to their several magnitudes; and, consequently,
the quickness or slowness of their motion,
and the time of their circumvolutions, is no argument
of the greater or less perfection. And, besides,
what virtue is there in a tragedy, which is
not contained in an epic poem, where pride is humbled,
virtue rewarded, and vice punished; and
those more amply treated, than the narrowness of
the drama can admit? The shining quality of an
epic hero, his magnanimity, his constancy, his patience,
his piety, or whatever characteristical virtue
his poet gives him, raises first our admiration. We
are naturally prone to imitate what we admire; and
frequent acts produce a habit. If the hero's chief
quality be vicious, as, for example, the choler and
obstinate desire of vengeance in Achilles, yet the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
moral is instructive: and, besides, we are informed
in the very proposition of the Iliads, that this
anger was pernicious; that it brought a thousand
ills on the Grecian camp. The courage of Achilles
is proposed to imitation, not his pride and disobedience
to his general, nor his brutal cruelty to his
dead enemy, nor the selling his body to his father.<a id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
We abhor these actions while we read them; and
what we abhor, we never imitate. The poet only
shews them, like rocks or quicksands, to be shunned.</p>

<p>By this example, the critics have concluded, that
it is not necessary the manners of the hero should
be virtuous. They are poetically good, if they are
of a piece; though, where a character of perfect
virtue is set before us, it is more lovely; for there
the whole hero is to be imitated. This is the &AElig;neas
of our author; this is that idea of perfection in an
epic poem, which painters and statuaries have only
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
in their minds, and which no hands are able to express.
These are the beauties of a god in a human
body. When the picture of Achilles is drawn in
tragedy, he is taken with those warts, and moles,
and hard features, by those who represent him on
the stage, or he is no more Achilles; for his creator,
Homer, has so described him. Yet even thus he appears
a perfect hero, though an imperfect character
of virtue. Horace paints him after Homer, and delivers
him to be copied on the stage with all those
imperfections.<a id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> Therefore they are either not faults
in a heroic poem, or faults common to the drama.
After all, on the whole merits of the cause, it must
be acknowledged, that the epic poem is more for the
manners, and tragedy for the passions. The passions,
as I have said, are violent; and acute distempers
require medicines of a strong and speedy
operation. Ill habits of the mind are like chronical
diseases, to be corrected by degrees, and cured by
alteratives; wherein, though purges are sometimes
necessary, yet diet, good air, and moderate exercise,
have the greatest part. The matter being thus stated,
it will appear, that both sorts of poetry are of
use for their proper ends. The stage is more active;
the epic poem works at greater leisure, yet is active
too, when need requires; for dialogue is imitated
by the drama, from the more active parts of it.
One puts off a fit, like the <i>quinquina</i>, and relieves
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
us only for a time; the other roots out the distemper,
and gives a healthful habit. The sun enlightens
and cheers us, dispels fogs, and warms the ground
with his daily beams; but the corn is sowed, increases,
is ripened, and is reaped for use in process
of time, and in its proper season. I proceed, from
the greatness of the action, to the dignity of the
actors; I mean to the persons employed in both
poems. There likewise tragedy will be seen to borrow
from the epopee; and that which borrows is
always of less dignity, because it has not of its own.
A subject, it is true, may lend to his sovereign;
but the act of borrowing makes the king inferior,
because he wants, and the subject supplies. And
suppose the persons of the drama wholly fabulous,
or of the poet's invention, yet heroic poetry gave
him the examples of that invention, because it was
first, and Homer the common father of the stage.
I know not of any one advantage which tragedy
can boast above heroic poetry, but that it is represented
to the view, as well as read, and instructs in
the closet, as well as on the theatre. This is an
uncontended excellence, and a chief branch of its
prerogative; yet I may be allowed to say, without
partiality, that herein the actors share the poet's
praise. Your lordship knows some modern tragedies
which are beautiful on the stage, and yet I
am confident you would not read them. "Tryphon
the stationer"<a id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> complains, they are seldom asked for
in his shop. The poet who flourished in the scene, is
damned in the <i>ruelle</i>;<a id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> nay more, he is not esteemed
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
a good poet by those, who see and hear his extravagancies
with delight. They are a sort of stately
fustian, and lofty childishness. Nothing but nature
can give a sincere pleasure; where that is not
imitated, it is grotesque painting; "the fine woman
ends in a fishes tail."</p>

<p>I might also add, that many things, which not
only please, but are real beauties in the reading,
would appear absurd upon the stage; and those not
only the <i>speciosa miracula</i>, as Horace calls them, of
transformations, of Scylla, Antiphates, and the L&aelig;strygons,
which cannot be represented even in operas;
but the prowess of Achilles or &AElig;neas would appear
ridiculous in our dwarf-heroes of the theatre. We
can believe they routed armies, in Homer or in Virgil;
but <i>ne Hercules contra duos</i> in the drama. I
forbear to instance in many things, which the stage
cannot, or ought not to represent; for I have said
already more than I intended on this subject, and
should fear it might be turned against me, that I
plead for the pre-eminence of epic poetry, because I
have taken some pains in translating Virgil, if this
were the first time that I had delivered my opinion
in this dispute. But I have more than once already
maintained the rights of my two masters against
their rivals of the scene,<a id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> even while I wrote tragedies
myself, and had no thoughts of this present
undertaking. I submit my opinion to your judgement,
who are better qualified than any man I know,
to decide this controversy. You come, my lord, instructed
in the cause, and needed not that I should
open it. Your "Essay of Poetry,"<a id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> which was
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
published without a name, and of which I was not
honoured with the confidence, I read over and over
with much delight, and as much instruction, and,
without flattering you, or making myself more moral
than I am&mdash;not without some envy. I was loth
to be informed how an epic poem should be written,
or how a tragedy should be contrived and
managed, in better verse, and with more judgment,
than I could teach others. A native of Parnassus,
and bred up in the studies of its fundamental laws,
may receive new lights from his contemporaries;
but it is a grudging kind of praise which he gives
his benefactors. He is more obliged, than he is
willing to acknowledge; there is a tincture of malice
in his commendations; for where I own I am
taught, I confess my want of knowledge. A judge
upon the bench may, out of good nature, or at least
interest, encourage the pleadings of a puny counsellor;
but he does not willingly commend his brother
serjeant at the bar, especially when he controuls
his law, and exposes that ignorance which is
made sacred by his place. I gave the unknown
author his due commendation, I must confess; but
who can answer for me, and for the rest of the
poets who heard me read the poem, whether we
should not have been better pleased to have seen
our own names at the bottom of the title-page?
Perhaps we commended it the more, that we might
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
seem to be above the censure. We are naturally
displeased with an unknown critic, as the ladies are
with a lampooner, because we are bitten in the
dark, and know not where to fasten our revenge.
But great excellencies will work their way through
all sorts of opposition. I applauded rather out of
decency, than affection; and was ambitious, as
some yet can witness, to be acquainted with a man,
with whom I had the honour to converse, and that
almost daily, for so many years together. Heaven
knows, if I have heartily forgiven you this deceit.
You extorted a praise, which I should willingly
have given, had I known you. Nothing had been
more easy, than to commend a patron of a long
standing. The world would join with me, if the
encomiums were just; and, if unjust, would excuse
a grateful flatterer. But to come anonymous upon
me, and force me to commend you against my interest,
was not altogether so fair, give me leave to
say, as it was politic; for, by concealing your quality,
you might clearly understand how your work
succeeded, and that the general approbation was
given to your merit, not your titles. Thus, like
Apelles, you stood unseen behind your own Venus,
and received the praises of the passing multitude;
the work was commended, not the author; and I
doubt not, this was one of the most pleasing adventures
of your life.<a id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>I have detained your lordship longer than I intended
in this dispute of preference betwixt the
epic poem and the drama, and yet have not formally
answered any of the arguments which are brought
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
by Aristotle on the other side, and set in the fairest
light by Dacier. But I suppose, without looking on
the book, I may have touched on some of the objections;
for, in this address to your lordship, I design
not a treatise of heroic poetry, but write in a loose
epistolary way, somewhat tending to that subject,
after the example of Horace, in his First Epistle of
the Second Book to Augustus C&aelig;sar, and in that to
the Piso's, which we call his "Art of Poetry;" in both
of which he observes no method that I can trace,
whatever Scaliger the father, or Heinsius, may have
seen, or rather think they had seen. I have taken
up, laid down, and resumed as often as I pleased,
the same subject; and this loose proceeding I shall
use through all this prefatory dedication. Yet all
this while I have been sailing with some side-wind
or other toward the point I proposed in the beginning,&mdash;the
greatness and excellency of a heroic
poem, with some of the difficulties which attend
that work. The comparison, therefore, which I
made betwixt the epopee and the tragedy, was not
altogether a digression; for it is concluded on all
hands, that they are both the master-pieces of human
wit.</p>

<p>In the mean time, I may be bold to draw this
corollary from what has been already said, that the
file of heroic poets is very short; all are not such
who have assumed that lofty title in ancient or modern
ages, or have been so esteemed by their partial
and ignorant admirers.</p>

<p>There have been but one great Ilias, and one
&AElig;ne&iuml;s, in so many ages. The next, but the next
with a long interval betwixt, was the Jerusalem;<a id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>
<p>I mean not so much in distance of time, as in
excellency. After these three are entered, some
lord-chamberlain should be appointed, some critic
of authority should be set before the door, to keep
out a crowd of little poets, who press for admission,
and are not of quality. M&aelig;vius would be deafening
your lordship's ears with his</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Fortunam Priami cantabo, et nobile bellum</i>&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>mere fustian, as Horace would tell you from behind,
without pressing forward, and more smoke
than fire. Pulci, Boiardo, and Ariosto,<a id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> would cry
out, "make room for the Italian poets, the descendants
of Virgil in a right line:" father Le Moine,
with his saint Louis; and Scudery with his Alaric,
for a godly king and a Gothic conqueror; and
Chapelain would take it ill that his <i>Maid</i> should be
refused a place with Helen and Lavinia.<a id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Spencer<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
has a better plea for his "Fairy Queen," had his
action been finished, or had been one; and Milton,
if the devil had not been his hero, instead of Adam;
if the giant had not foiled the knight, and driven
him out of his strong-hold, to wander through the
world with his lady errant; and if there had not
been more machining persons than human in his
poem. After these, the rest of our English poets
shall not be mentioned. I have that honour for
them which I ought to have; but, if they are worthies,
they are not to be ranked amongst the three
whom I have named, and who are established in
their reputation.</p>

<p>Before I quitted the comparison betwixt epic
poetry and tragedy, I should have acquainted my
judge with one advantage of the former over the
latter, which I now casually remember out of the
preface of S&eacute;grais before his translation of the &AElig;ne&iuml;s,
or out of Bossu, no matter which: "The style of
the heroic poem is, and ought to be, more lofty than
that of the drama." The critic is certainly in the
right, for the reason already urged; the work of
tragedy is on the passions, and in a dialogue; both
of them abhor strong metaphors, in which the epopee
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
delights. A poet cannot speak too plainly on
the stage: for <i>volat irrevocabile verbum</i>; the sense
is lost, if it be not taken flying. But what we read
alone, we have leisure to digest; there an author
may beautify his sense by the boldness of his expression,
which if we understand not fully at the
first, we may dwell upon it, till we find the secret
force and excellence. That which cures the manners
by alterative physic, as I said before, must
proceed by insensible degrees; but that which purges
the passions, must do its business all at once, or
wholly fail of its effect, at least in the present operation,
and without repeated doses. We must beat
the iron while it is hot, but we may polish it at leisure.
Thus, my lord, you pay the fine of my
forgetfulness; and yet the merits of both causes
are where they were, and undecided, till you declare
whether it be more for the benefit of mankind
to have their manners in general corrected, or their
pride and hard-heartedness removed.</p>

<p>I must now come closer to my present business,
and not think of making more invasive wars abroad,
when, like Hannibal, I am called back to the defence
of my own country. Virgil is attacked by
many enemies; he has a whole confederacy against
him; and I must endeavour to defend him as well
as I am able. But their principal objections being
against his moral, the duration or length of time
taken up in the action of the poem, and what they
have to urge against the manners of his hero; I
shall omit the rest as mere cavils of grammarians;
at the worst, but casual slips of a great man's pen,
or inconsiderable faults of an admirable poem, which
the author had not leisure to review before his
death. Macrobius has answered what the ancients
could urge against him; and some things I have
lately read in Tanneguy le F&egrave;vre, Valois, and another
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
whom I name not, which are scarce worth answering.
They begin with the moral of his poem,
which I have elsewhere confessed, and still must
own, not to be so noble as that of Homer.<a id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> But
let both be fairly stated; and, without contradicting
my first opinion, I can shew, that Virgil's was
as useful to the Romans of his age, as Homer's was
to the Grecians of his, in what time soever he may
be supposed to have lived and flourished. Homer's
moral was to urge the necessity of union, and of a
good understanding betwixt confederate states and
princes engaged in a war with a mighty monarch;
as also of discipline in an army, and obedience in
the several chiefs to the supreme commander of the
joint forces. To inculcate this, he sets forth the
ruinous effects of discord in the camp of those allies,
occasioned by the quarrel betwixt the general and
one of the next in office under him. Agamemnon
gives the provocation, and Achilles resents the injury.
Both parties are faulty in the quarrel; and
accordingly they are both punished: the aggressor
is forced to sue for peace to his inferior on dishonourable
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
conditions: the deserter refuses the satisfaction
offered; and his obstinacy costs him his
best friend. This works the natural effect of choler,
and turns his rage against him by whom he was
last affronted, and most sensibly. The greater anger
expels the less; but his character is still preserved.
In the mean time, the Grecian army receives
loss on loss, and is half destroyed by a pestilence
into the bargain:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Quidquid delirant reges, plectuntur Achivi</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As the poet, in the first part of the example, had
shewn the bad effects of discord, so, after the reconcilement,
he gives the good effects of unity;
for Hector is slain, and then Troy must fall. By
this it is probable, that Homer lived when the Median
monarchy was grown formidable to the Grecians,
and that the joint endeavours of his countrymen
were little enough to preserve their common
freedom from an encroaching enemy. Such was
his moral, which all critics have allowed to be more
noble than that of Virgil, though not adapted to
the times in which the Roman poet lived. Had
Virgil flourished in the age of Ennius, and addressed
to Scipio, he had probably taken the same moral,
or some other not unlike it: for then the Romans
were in as much danger from the Carthaginian
commonwealth, as the Grecians were from the
Assyrian or Median monarchy. But we are to consider
him as writing his poem in a time when the
old form of government was subverted, and a new
one just established by Octavius C&aelig;sar, in effect by
force of arms, but seemingly by the consent of the
Roman people. The commonwealth had received
a deadly wound in the former civil wars betwixt
Marius and Sylla. The commons, while the first
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
prevailed, had almost shaken off the yoke of the
nobility; and Marius and Cinna, like the captains
of the mob, under the specious pretence of the public
good, and of doing justice on the oppressors of
their liberty, revenged themselves, without form of
law, on their private enemies. Sylla, in his turn,
proscribed the heads of the adverse party: he too
had nothing but liberty and reformation in his
mouth; (for the cause of religion is but a modern
motive to rebellion, invented by the Christian priesthood,
refining on the heathen;<a id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>) Sylla, to be sure,
meant no more good to the Roman people than Marius
before him, whatever he declared; but sacrificed
the lives, and took the estates, of all his enemies, to
gratify those who brought him into power. Such
was the reformation of the government by both
parties. The senate and the commons were the
two bases on which it stood; and the two champions
of either faction, each, destroyed the foundations
of the other side; so the fabric, of consequence,
must fall betwixt them, and tyranny must
be built upon their ruins. This comes of altering
fundamental laws and constitutions&mdash;like him, who,
being in good health, lodged himself in a physician's
house, and was over-persuaded by his landlord
to take physic, (of which he died,) for the benefit
of his doctor. <i>Stavo ben</i>: (was written on his
monument) <i>ma, per star meglio, sto qu&igrave;</i>.</p>

<p>After the death of those two usurpers, the commonwealth
seemed to recover, and held up its head
for a little time. But it was all the while in a deep
consumption, which is a flattering disease. Pompey,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
Crassus, and C&aelig;sar, had found the sweets of
arbitrary power; and, each being a check to the
other's growth, struck up a false friendship amongst
themselves, and divided the government betwixt
them, which none of them was able to assume alone.
These were the public-spirited men of their age;
that is, patriots for their own interest. The commonwealth
looked with a florid countenance in their
management, spread in bulk, and all the while was
wasting in the vitals. Not to trouble your lordship
with the repetition of what you know&mdash;after the
death of Crassus, Pompey found himself outwitted
by C&aelig;sar, broke with him, overpowered him in the
senate, and caused many unjust decrees to pass
against him. C&aelig;sar, thus injured, and unable to
resist the faction of the nobles which was now uppermost,
(for he was a Marian,) had recourse to
arms; and his cause was just against Pompey, but
not against his country, whose constitution ought
to have been sacred to him, and never to have been
violated on the account of any private wrong. But
he prevailed; and, heaven declaring for him, he became
a providential monarch, under the title of perpetual
dictator. He being murdered by his own
son,<a id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> whom I neither dare commend, nor can justly
blame, (though Dante, in his <i>Inferno</i>, has put
him and Cassius, and Judas Iscariot betwixt them,
into the great devil's mouth,) the commonwealth
popped up its head for the third time, under Brutus
and Cassius, and then sunk for ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus the Roman people were grossly gulled twice
or thrice over, and as often enslaved in one century,
and under the same pretence of reformation. At
last the two battles of Philippi gave the decisive
stroke against liberty; and, not long after, the commonwealth
was turned into a monarchy, by the
conduct and good fortune of Augustus. It is true,
that the despotic power could not have fallen into
better hands than those of the first and second C&aelig;sar.
Your lordship well knows what obligations
Virgil had to the latter of them: he saw, beside,
that the commonwealth was lost without resource;
the heads of it destroyed; the senate new moulded,
grown degenerate, and either bought off, or thrusting
their own necks into the yoke, out of fear of
being forced. Yet I may safely affirm for our great
author, (as men of good sense are generally honest,)
that he was still of republican principles in his heart.</p>

</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>I think, I need use no other argument to justify
my opinion, than that of this one line, taken from
the eighth book of the &AElig;ne&iuml;s. If he had not well
studied his patron's temper, it might have ruined
him with another prince. But Augustus was not
discontented, at least that we can find, that Cato
was placed, by his own poet, in Elysium, and there
giving laws to the holy souls who deserved to be
separated from the vulgar sort of good spirits; for
his conscience could not but whisper to the arbitrary
monarch, that the kings of Rome were at first
elective, and governed not without a senate;&mdash;that
Romulus was no hereditary prince; and though,
after his death, he received divine honours for the
good he did on earth, yet he was but a god of their
own making;&mdash;that the last Tarquin was expelled
justly for overt acts of tyranny, and mal-administration;
for such are the conditions of an elective
kingdom: and I meddle not with others, being, for
my own opinion, of Montaigne's principles, that an
honest man ought to be contented with that form
of government, and with those fundamental constitutions
of it, which he received from his ancestors,
and under which himself was born; though at the
same time he confessed freely, that, if he could have
chosen his place of birth, it should have been at
Venice&mdash;which, for many reasons, I dislike, and am
better pleased to have been born an Englishman.</p>

<p>But, to return from my long rambling&mdash;I say,
that Virgil having maturely weighed the condition
of the times in which he lived; that an entire
liberty was not to be retrieved; that the present
settlement had the prospect of a long continuance
in the same family, or those adopted into it; that
he held his paternal estate from the bounty of the
conqueror, by whom he was likewise enriched,
esteemed, and cherished; that this conqueror,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
though of a bad kind, was the very best of it;
that the arts of peace flourished under him; that
all men might be happy, if they would be quiet;
that, now he was in possession of the whole, yet
he shared a great part of his authority with the
senate; that he would be chosen into the ancient
offices of the commonwealth, and ruled by the
power which he derived from them, and prorogued
his government from time to time, still, as it were,
threatening to dismiss himself from public cares,
which he exercised more for the common good,
than for any delight he took in greatness;&mdash;these
things, I say, being considered by the poet, he concluded
it to be the interest of his country to be so
governed; to infuse an awful respect into the people
towards such a prince; by that respect to confirm
their obedience to him, and by that obedience
to make them happy. This was the moral of his
divine poem;<a id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>&mdash;honest in the poet; honourable to
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
the emperor, whom he derives from a divine extraction;
and reflecting part of that honour on the
Roman people, whom he derives also from the
Trojans; and not only profitable, but necessary, to
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
the present age, and likely to be such to their
posterity. That it was the received opinion, that
the Romans were descended from the Trojans, and
Julius C&aelig;sar from I&uuml;lus the son of &AElig;neas, was
enough for Virgil; though perhaps he thought not
so himself, or that &AElig;neas ever was in Italy; which
Bochartus manifestly proves. And Homer, where
he says that Jupiter hated the house of Priam, and
was resolved to transfer the kingdom to the family
of &AElig;neas, yet mentions nothing of his leading a
colony into a foreign country, and settling there.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
But that the Romans valued themselves on their
Trojan ancestry, is so undoubted a truth, that I
need not prove it. Even the seals which we have
remaining of Julius C&aelig;sar, which we know to be
antique, have the star of Venus over them, (though
they were all graven after his death,) as a note that
he was deified. I doubt not but one reason, why
Augustus should be so passionately concerned for
the preservation of the &AElig;ne&iuml;s, which its author had
condemned to be burnt, as an imperfect poem, by
his last will and testament, was, because it did him
a real service, as well as an honour; that a work
should not be lost, where his divine original was
celebrated in verse, which had the character of immortality
stamped upon it.</p>

<p>Neither were the great Roman families, which
flourished in his time, less obliged by him than the
emperor. Your lordship knows with what address
he makes mention of them, as captains of ships, or
leaders in the war; and even some of Italian extraction
are not forgotten. These are the single
stars which are sprinkled through the &AElig;ne&iuml;s: but
there are whole constellations of them in the fifth
book. And I could not but take notice, when I
translated it, of some favourite families to which
he gives the victory and awards the prizes, in the
person of his hero, at the funeral games which were
celebrated in honour of Anchises. I insist not on
their names; but am pleased to find the Memmii
amongst them, derived from Mnestheus, because
Lucretius dedicates to one of that family, a branch
of which destroyed Corinth. I likewise either
found or formed an image to myself of the contrary
kind; that those, who lost the prizes, were
such as had disobliged the poet, or were in disgrace
with Augustus, or enemies to M&aelig;cenas; and this
was the poetical revenge he took: for <i>genus irritabile</i>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
<i>vatum</i>, as Horace says.<a id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> When a poet is
thoroughly provoked, he will do himself justice,
however dear it cost him; <i>animamque in vulnere
ponit</i>. I think these are not bare imaginations of
my own, though I find no trace of them in the
commentators; but one poet may judge of another
by himself. The vengeance we defer, is not forgotten.
I hinted before, that the whole Roman
people were obliged by Virgil, in deriving them
from Troy; an ancestry which they affected. We
and the French are of the same humour: they
would be thought to descend from a son, I think,
of Hector; and we would have our Britain both
named and planted by a descendant of &AElig;neas.
Spenser favours this opinion what he can. His
Prince Arthur, or whoever he intends by him, is
a Trojan. Thus the hero of Homer was a Grecian,
of Virgil a Roman, of Tasso an Italian.</p>

<p>I have transgressed my bounds, and gone farther
than the moral led me; but, if your lordship is not
tired, I am safe enough.</p>

<p>Thus far, I think, my author is defended. But,
as Augustus is still shadowed in the person of
&AElig;neas, (of which I shall say more, when I come
to the manners which the poet gives his hero,) I
must prepare that subject, by shewing how dexterously
he managed both the prince and people, so
as to displease neither, and to do good to both;
which is the part of a wise and an honest man,
and proves, that it is possible for a courtier not to
be a knave. I shall continue still to speak my
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
thoughts like a free-born subject, as I am; though
such things, perhaps, as no Dutch commentator
could, and I am sure no Frenchman durst. I have
already told your lordship my opinion of Virgil,
that he was no arbitrary man. Obliged he was to
his master for his bounty; and he repays him with
good counsel, how to behave himself in his new
monarchy, so as to gain the affections of his subjects,
and deserve to be called the father of his
country. From this consideration it is, that he
chose, for the ground-work of his poem, one empire
destroyed, and another raised from the ruins
of it. This was just the parallel. &AElig;neas could not
pretend to be Priam's heir in a lineal succession;
for Anchises, the hero's father, was only of the
second branch of the royal family; and Helenus, a
son of Priam, was yet surviving, and might lawfully
claim before him. It may be, Virgil mentions him
on that account. Neither has he forgotten Priamus,
in the fifth of his &AElig;ne&iuml;s, the son of Polites,
youngest son to Priam, who was slain by Pyrrhus,
in the second book. &AElig;neas had only married
Cre&uuml;sa, Priam's daughter, and by her could have
no title, while any of the male issue were remaining.
In this case, the poet gave him the next title,
which is that of an elective king. The remaining
Trojans chose him to lead them forth, and settle
them in some foreign country. Ilioneus, in his
speech to Dido, calls him expressly by the name of
king. Our poet, who all this while had Augustus
in his eye, had no desire he should seem to succeed
by any right of inheritance derived from Julius
C&aelig;sar, (such a title being but one degree removed
from conquest,) for what was introduced by force,
by force may be removed. It was better for the
people that they should give, than he should take;
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
since that gift was indeed no more at bottom, than
a trust. Virgil gives us an example of this in the
person of Mezentius: he governed arbitrarily; he
was expelled, and came to the deserved end of all
tyrants. Our author shows us another sort of
kingship, in the person of Latinus: he was descended
from Saturn, and, as I remember, in the
third degree. He is described a just and gracious
prince, solicitous for the welfare of his people, always
consulting with his senate to promote the
common good. We find him at the head of them,
when he enters into the council-hall, speaking first,
but still demanding their advice, and steering by it,
as far as the iniquity of the times would suffer him.
And this is the proper character of a king by inheritance,
who is born a father of his country. &AElig;neas,
though he married the heiress of the crown, yet
claimed no title to it during the life of his father-in-law.
<i>Pater arma Latinus habeto</i>, &amp;c. are Virgil's
words. As for himself, he was contented to
take care of his country gods, who were not those
of Latium; wherein our divine author seems to
relate to the after-practice of the Romans, which
was to adopt the gods of those they conquered, or
received as members of their commonwealth. Yet,
withal, he plainly touches at the office of the high-priesthood,
with which Augustus was invested, and
which made his person more sacred and inviolable,
than even the tribunitial power. It was not therefore
for nothing, that the most judicious of all poets
made that office vacant by the death of Panth&ucirc;s in
the second book of the &AElig;ne&iuml;s, for his hero to succeed
in it, and consequently for Augustus to enjoy.
I know not that any of the commentators have
taken notice of that passage. If they have not, I
am sure they ought; and if they have, I am not
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
indebted to them for the observation. The words
of Virgil are very plain&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Sacra, suosque tibi commendat Troja penates.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As for Augustus, or his uncle Julius, claiming by
descent from &AElig;neas, that title is already out of
doors. &AElig;neas succeeded not, but was elected.
Troy was fore-doomed to fall for ever.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Postquam res Asi&aelig; Priamique evertere gentem</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Immeritam visum superis.</i>&mdash;&AElig;ne&iuml;s, Lib. III. v. 1.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Augustus, it is true, had once resolved to rebuild
that city, and there to make the seat of empire:
but Horace writes an ode on purpose to deter him
from that thought; declaring the place to be accursed,
and that the gods would as often destroy it,
as it should be raised.<a id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> Hereupon the emperor
laid aside a project so ungrateful to the Roman
people. But by this, my lord, we may conclude,
that he had still his pedigree in his head, and had
an itch of being thought a divine king, if his poets
had not given him better counsel.</p>

<p>I will pass by many less material objections, for
want of room to answer them: what follows next
is of great importance, if the critics can make out
their charge; for it is levelled at the manners which
our poet gives his hero, and which are the same
which were eminently seen in his Augustus. Those
manners were, piety to the gods and a dutiful affection
to his father, love to his relations, care of
his people, courage and conduct in the wars, gratitude
to those who had obliged him, and justice in
general to mankind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>Piety, as your lordship sees, takes place of all, as
the chief part of his character; and the word in
Latin is more full than it can possibly be expressed
in any modern language; for there it comprehends
not only devotion to the gods, but filial love, and
tender affection to relations of all sorts. As instances
of this, the deities of Troy, and his own
Penates, are made the companions of his flight:
they appear to him in his voyage, and advise him;
and at last he replaces them in Italy, their native
country. For his father, he takes him on his back:
he leads his little son: his wife follows him; but,
losing his footsteps through fear or ignorance, he
goes back into the midst of his enemies to find her,
and leaves not his pursuit until her ghost appears,
to forbid his farther search. I will say nothing of
his duty to his father while he lived, his sorrow for
his death, of the games instituted in honour of his
memory, or seeking him, by his command, even
after his death, in the Elysian fields. I will not
mention his tenderness for his son, which everywhere
is visible&mdash;of his raising a tomb for Polydorus,
the obsequies for Misenus, his pious remembrance
of De&iuml;phobus, the funerals of his nurse, his
grief for Pallas, and his revenge taken on his murderer,
whom otherwise, by his natural compassion,
he had forgiven: and then the poem had been left
imperfect; for we could have had no certain prospect
of his happiness, while the last obstacle to it
was unremoved. Of the other parts which compose
his character, as a king, or as a general, I need
say nothing; the whole &AElig;ne&iuml;s is one continued
instance of some one or other of them; and where
I find any thing of them taxed, it shall suffice me,
as briefly as I can, to vindicate my divine master to
your lordship, and by you to the reader. But herein
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
S&eacute;grais, in his admirable preface to his translation
of the &AElig;ne&iuml;s, as the author of the Dauphin's Virgil
justly calls it, has prevented me. Him I follow,
and what I borrow from him, am ready to acknowledge
to him. For, impartially speaking, the French
are as much better critics than the English, as they
are worse poets. Thus we generally allow, that
they better understand the management of a war
than our islanders; but we know we are superior
to them in the day of battle. They value themselves
on their generals, we on our soldiers. But
this is not the proper place to decide that question,
if they make it one. I shall perhaps say as much
of other nations, and their poets, excepting only
Tasso; and hope to make my assertion good, which
is but doing justice to my country; part of which
honour will reflect on your lordship, whose thoughts
are always just; your numbers harmonious, your
words chosen, your expressions strong and manly,
your verse flowing, and your turns as happy as they
are easy. If you would set us more copies, your
example would make all precepts needless. In the
mean time, that little you have written is owned,
and that particularly by the poets, (who are a nation
not over lavish of praise to their contemporaries,)
as a principal ornament of our language; but the
sweetest essences are always confined in the smallest
glasses.</p>

<p>When I speak of your lordship, it is never a digression,
and therefore I need beg no pardon for it;
but take up S&eacute;grais where I left him, and shall use
him less often than I have occasion for him; for
his preface is a perfect piece of criticism, full and
clear, and digested into an exact method; mine is
loose, and, as I intended it, epistolary. Yet I dwell
on many things, which he durst not touch; for it
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
is dangerous to offend an arbitrary master; and
every patron, who has the power of Augustus, has
not his clemency. In short, my lord, I would
not translate him, because I would bring you somewhat
of my own. His notes and observations on
every book are of the same excellency; and, for
the same reason, I omit the greater part.</p>

<p>He takes notice that Virgil is arraigned for placing
piety before valour, and making that piety the
chief character of his hero. I have said already
from Bossu, that a poet is not obliged to make his
hero a virtuous man; therefore, neither Homer nor
Tasso are to be blamed, for giving what predominant
quality they pleased to their first character.
But Virgil, who designed to form a perfect prince,
and would insinuate that Augustus, whom he calls
&AElig;neas in his poem, was truly such, found himself
obliged to make him without blemish, thoroughly
virtuous; and a thorough virtue both begins and
ends in piety. Tasso, without question, observed
this before me, and therefore split his hero in two:
he gave Godfrey piety, and Rinaldo fortitude, for
their chief qualities or manners. Homer, who had
chosen another moral, makes both Agamemnon
and Achilles vicious; for his design was to instruct
in virtue, by shewing the deformity of vice. I
avoid repetition of what I have said above. What
follows, is translated literally from S&eacute;grais.</p>

<p>"Virgil had considered, that the greatest virtues
of Augustus consisted in the perfect art of governing
his people; which caused him to reign for more
than forty years in great felicity. He considered,
that his emperor was valiant, civil, popular, eloquent,
politic, and religious; he has given all these qualities
to &AElig;neas. But, knowing that piety alone comprehends
the whole duty of man towards the gods,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
towards his country, and towards his relations, he
judged, that this ought to be his first character,
whom he would set for a pattern of perfection. In
reality, they who believe, that the praises which
arise from valour are superior to those which proceed
from any other virtues, have not considered,
(as they ought,) that valour, destitute of other virtues,
cannot render a man worthy of any true esteem.
That quality, which signifies no more than
an intrepid courage, may be separated from many
others which are good, and accompanied with many
which are ill. A man may be very valiant, and
yet impious and vicious. But the same cannot be
said of piety, which excludes all ill qualities, and
comprehends even valour itself, with all other qualities
which are good. Can we, for example, give
the praise of valour to a man, who should see his
gods prophaned, and should want the courage to
defend them? to a man, who should abandon his
father, or desert his king, in his last necessity?"</p>

<p>Thus far S&eacute;grais, in giving the preference to piety
before valour. I will now follow him, where
he considers this valour, or intrepid courage, singly
in itself; and this also Virgil gives to his &AElig;neas,
and that in a heroical degree.</p>

<p>Having first concluded, that our poet did for the
best in taking the first character of his hero from
that essential virtue on which the rest depend, he
proceeds to tell us, that, in the ten years' war of
Troy, he was considered as the second champion of
his country, (allowing Hector the first place;) and
this, even by the confession of Homer, who took
all occasions of setting up his own countrymen the
Grecians, and of undervaluing the Trojan chiefs.
But Virgil (whom S&eacute;grais forgot to cite) makes
Diomede give him a higher character for strength
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
and courage. His testimony is this, in the Eleventh
Book:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<i>Stetimus tela aspera contra,</i><br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>I give not here my translation of these verses,
(though I think I have not ill succeeded in them,)
because your lordship is so great a master of the
original, that I have no reason to desire you should
see Virgil and me so near together; but you may
please, my lord, to take notice, that the Latin author
refines upon the Greek, and insinuates, that
Homer had done his hero wrong, in giving the advantage
of the duel to his own countryman; though
Diomede was manifestly the second champion of
the Grecians; and Ulysses preferred him before Ajax,
when he chose him for the companion of his
nightly expedition; for he had a headpiece of his
own, and wanted only the fortitude of another, to
bring him off with safety, and that he might compass
his design with honour.</p>

<p>The French translator thus proceeds: "They, who
accuse &AElig;neas for want of courage, either understand
not Virgil, or have read him slightly; otherwise
they would not raise an objection so easy to
be answered." Hereupon he gives so many instances
of the hero's valour, that to repeat them after
him would tire your lordship, and put me to the
unnecessary trouble of transcribing the greatest part
of the three last &AElig;neids. In short, more could not
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
be expected from an Amadis, a Sir Lancelot, or the
whole Round Table, than he performs. <i>Proxima
qu&aelig;que metit gladio</i>, is the perfect account of a
knight-errant. "If it be replied," continues S&eacute;grais,
"that it was not difficult for him to undertake and
achieve such hardy enterprises, because he wore enchanted
arms; that accusation, in the first place,
must fall on Homer, ere it can reach Virgil." Achilles
was as well provided with them as &AElig;neas,
though he was invulnerable without them.<a id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> And
Ariosto, the two Tassos, (Bernardo and Torquato,)
even our own Spenser&mdash;in a word, all modern poets&mdash;have
copied Homer as well as Virgil: he is neither
the first nor last, but in the midst of them; and
therefore is safe, if they are so. "Who knows,"
says S&eacute;grais, "but that his fated armour was only
an allegorical defence, and signified no more than
that he was under the peculiar protection of the
gods? born, as the astrologers will tell us out of
Virgil, (who was well versed in the Chaldean mysteries,)
under the favourable influence of Jupiter,
Venus, and the Sun." But I insist not on this,
because I know you believe not there is such an
art; though not only Horace and Persius, but Augustus
himself, thought otherwise. But, in defence
of Virgil, I dare positively say, that he has been
more cautious in this particular than either his predecessor,
or his descendants: for &AElig;neas was actually
wounded, in the Twelfth of the &AElig;neis; though
he had the same godsmith<a id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> to forge his arms as had
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
Achilles. It seems he was no <i>warluck</i>,<a id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> as the Scots
commonly call such men, who, they say, are iron-free,
or lead-free. Yet, after this experiment, that
his arms were not impenetrable&mdash;when he was cured
indeed by his mother's help, because he was
that day to conclude the war by the death of Turnus&mdash;the
poet durst not carry the miracle too far,
and restore him wholly to his former vigour: he
was still too weak to overtake his enemy; yet we
see with what courage he attacks Turnus, when
he faces and renews the combat. I need say no
more; for Virgil defends himself without needing
my assistance, and proves his hero truly to deserve
that name. He was not then a second-rate champion,
as they would have him, who think fortitude
the first virtue in a hero. But, being beaten from
this hold, they will not yet allow him to be valiant,
because he wept more often, as they think, than
well becomes a man of courage.</p>

<p>In the first place, if tears are arguments of
cowardice, what shall I say of Homer's hero?
Shall Achilles pass for timorous, because he wept,
and wept on less occasions than &AElig;neas? Herein
Virgil must be granted to have excelled his master.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
For once both heroes are described lamenting
their lost loves: Brise&iuml;s was taken away by
force from the Grecians; Cre&uuml;sa was lost for ever
to her husband. But Achilles went roaring along
the salt sea-shore, and, like a booby, was complaining
to his mother, when he should have revenged
his injury by arms. &AElig;neas took a nobler
course; for, having secured his father and his
son, he repeated all his former dangers, to have
found his wife, if she had been above ground.
And here your lordship may observe the address
of Virgil; it was not for nothing that this passage
was related with all these tender circumstances.
&AElig;neas told it; Dido heard it. That he had
been so affectionate a husband, was no ill argument
to the coming dowager, that he might prove
as kind to her. Virgil has a thousand secret
beauties, though I have not leisure to remark
them.</p>

<p>S&eacute;grais, on this subject of a hero shedding tears,
observes, that historians commend Alexander for
weeping when he read the mighty actions of Achilles;
and Julius C&aelig;sar is likewise praised, when,
out of the same noble envy, he wept at the victories
of Alexander. But, if we observe more closely,
we shall find, that the tears of &AElig;neas were always
on a laudable occasion. Thus he weeps out
of compassion and tenderness of nature, when, in
the temple of Carthage, he beholds the pictures of
his friends, who sacrificed their lives in defence of
their country. He deplores the lamentable end of
his pilot Palinurus, the untimely death of young
Pallas his confederate, and the rest, which I omit.
Yet, even for these tears, his wretched critics dare
condemn him. They make &AElig;neas little better
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
than a kind of St Swithin<a id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> hero, always raining.
One of these censors is bold enough to argue him
of cowardice, when, in the beginning of the first
book, he not only weeps, but trembles, at an approaching
storm&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Extemplo &AElig;ne&aelig; solvuntur frigore membra:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ingemit; et duplices tendens ad sidera palmas</i>, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But to this I have answered formerly, that his
fear was not for himself, but for his people. And
what can give a sovereign a better commendation,
or recommend a hero more to the affection of the
reader? They were threatened with a tempest,
and he wept; he was promised Italy, and therefore
he prayed for the accomplishment of that
promise:&mdash;all this in the beginning of a storm;
therefore he shewed the more early piety, and the
quicker sense of compassion. Thus much I have
urged elsewhere in the defence of Virgil; and, since,
I have been informed by Mr Moyle,<a id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> a young
gentleman whom I can never sufficiently commend,
that the ancients accounted drowning an accursed
death; so that, if we grant him to have been
afraid, he had just occasion for that fear, both in
relation to himself and to his subjects. I think our
adversaries can carry this argument no farther, unless
they tell us, that he ought to have had more</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>

<p>confidence in the promise of the gods; but how
was he assured, that he had understood their oracles
aright? Helenus might be mistaken; Ph&oelig;bus might
speak doubtfully; even his mother might flatter
him, that he might prosecute his voyage, which if
it succeeded happily, he should be the founder of
an empire; for, that she herself was doubtful of
his fortune, is apparent by the address she made to
Jupiter on his behalf; to which the god makes answer
in these words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Parce met&ucirc;, Cytherea: manent immota tuorum</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Fata tibi</i>, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>notwithstanding which, the goddess, though comforted,
was not assured; for, even after this, through
the course of the whole &AElig;ne&iuml;s, she still apprehends
the interest which Juno might make with Jupiter
against her son. For it was a moot point in heaven,
whether he could alter fate, or not. And indeed
some passages in Virgil would make us suspect, that
he was of opinion Jupiter might defer fate, though
he could not alter it; for, in the latter end of the
tenth book, he introduces Juno begging for the life
of Turnus, and flattering her husband with the power
of changing destiny&mdash;<i>Tua, qui potes, orsa reflectas!</i>
To which he graciously answers:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Si mora pr&aelig;sentis leti, tempusque caduco</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Oratur juveni, meque hoc ita ponere sentis,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Tolle fug&acirc; Turnum, atque instantibus eripe fatis.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Hactenus indulsisse vacat. Sin altior istis</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sub precibus venia ulla latet, totumque moveri</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Mutarive putas bellum, spes pascis inanes.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>But, that he could not alter those decrees, the
king of gods himself confesses, in the book above
cited, when he comforts Hercules for the death
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
of Pallas, who had invoked his aid, before he threw
his lance at Turnus&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<i>Troj&aelig; sub m&aelig;nibus altis,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Tot nati cecidere de&ucirc;m; quin occidit un&acirc;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sarpedon, mea progenies. Etiam sua Turnum</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Fata manent, metasque dati pervenit ad &aelig;vi&mdash;</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>where he plainly acknowledges, that he could not
save his own son, or prevent the death which he
foresaw. Of his power to defer the blow, I once
occasionally discoursed with that excellent person
Sir Robert Howard,<a id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> who is better conversant,
than any man that I know, in the doctrine of the
Stoics; and he set me right, from the concurrent
testimony of philosophers and poets, that Jupiter
could not retard the effects of fate, even for a
moment. For, when I cited Virgil, as favouring
the contrary opinion in that verse,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Tolle fug&acirc; Turnum, atque instantibus eripe fatis</i>&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>he replied, and, I think, with exact judgment,
that, when Jupiter gave Juno leave to withdraw
Turnus from the present danger, it was because
he certainly foreknew that his fatal hour was not
come; that it was in destiny for Juno at that
time to save him; and that himself obeyed destiny,
in giving her that leave.</p>

<p>I need say no more in justification of our
hero's courage, and am much deceived, if he ever
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
be attacked on this side of his character again.
But he is arraigned with more shew of reason by
the ladies, who will make a numerous party against
him, for being false to love, in forsaking Dido.
And I cannot much blame them; for, to say the
truth, it is an ill precedent for their gallants to follow.
Yet, if I can bring him off with flying colours,
they may learn experience at her cost, and,
for her sake, avoid a cave, as the worst shelter they
can chuse from a shower of rain, especially when
they have a lover in their company.</p>

<p>In the first place, S&eacute;grais observes with much
acuteness, that they who blame &AElig;neas for his insensibility
of love when he left Carthage, contradict
their former accusation of him, for being
always crying, compassionate, and effeminately
sensible of those misfortunes which befel others.
They give him two contrary characters; but Virgil
makes him of a piece, always grateful, always
tender-hearted. But they are impudent enough
to discharge themselves of this blunder, by laying
the contradiction at Virgil's door. He, say they,
has shewn his hero with these inconsistent characters,
acknowledging and ungrateful, compassionate
and hard-hearted, but, at the bottom, fickle and self-interested;
for Dido had not only received his
weather-beaten troops before she saw him, and given
them her protection, but had also offered them an
equal share in her dominion&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Vultis et his mecum pariter considere regnis?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Urbem quam statuo, vestra est.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>This was an obligement never to be forgotten;
and the more to be considered, because antecedent
to her love. That passion, it is true, produced
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
the usual effects, of generosity, gallantry,
and care to please; and thither we refer them. But,
when she had made all these advances, it was still
in his power to have refused them; after the intrigue
of the cave, (call it marriage, or enjoyment
only,) he was no longer free to take or leave; he
had accepted the favour, and was obliged to be constant,
if he would be grateful.</p>

<p>My lord, I have set this argument in the best
light I can, that the ladies may not think I write
booty; and perhaps it may happen to me, as it
did to Doctor Cudworth,<a id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> who has raised such
strong objections against the being of a God,
and Providence, that many think he has not answered
them. You may please at least to hear the
adverse party. S&eacute;grais pleads for Virgil, that no
less than an absolute command from Jupiter could
excuse this insensibility of the hero, and this abrupt
departure, which looks so like extreme ingratitude.
But, at the same time, he does wisely
to remember you, that Virgil had made piety the
first character of &AElig;neas; and, this being allowed,
(as I am afraid it must,) he was obliged, antecedent
to all other considerations, to search an asylum
for his gods in Italy&mdash;for those very gods, I say,
who had promised to his race the universal empire.
Could a pious man dispense with the commands
of Jupiter, to satisfy his passion, or (take it in the
strongest sense) to comply with the obligations of
his gratitude? Religion, it is true, must have moral
honesty for its ground-work, or we shall be apt to
suspect its truth; but an immediate revelation dispenses
with all duties of morality. All casuists
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
agree, that theft is a breach of the moral law; yet,
if I might presume to mingle things sacred with
prophane, the Israelites only spoiled the Egyptians,
not robbed them, because the propriety was transferred
by a revelation to their law-giver. I confess,
Dido was a very infidel in this point; for she would
not believe, as Virgil makes her say, that ever Jupiter
would send Mercury on such an immoral errand.
But this needs no answer, at least no more than
Virgil gives it&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Fata obstant; placidasque viri Deus obstruit aures.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This notwithstanding, as S&eacute;grais confesses, he
might have shewn a little more sensibility when
he left her; for that had been according to his
character.</p>

<p>But let Virgil answer for himself. He still loved
her, and struggled with his inclinations, to obey
the gods:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;<i>Curam sub corde premebat,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Multa gemens, magnoque animum labefactus amore.</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>Upon the whole matter, and humanly speaking,
I doubt there was a fault somewhere: and Jupiter
is better able to bear the blame, than either Virgil
or &AElig;neas. The poet, it seems, had found it out,
and therefore brings the deserting hero and the forsaken
lady to meet together in the lower regions,
where he excuses himself when it is too late; and
accordingly she will take no satisfaction, nor so
much as hear him. Now S&eacute;grais is forced to abandon
his defence, and excuses his author, by saying,
that the &AElig;ne&iuml;s is an imperfect work, and that death
prevented the divine poet from reviewing it; and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
for that reason he had condemned it to the fire;<a id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
though, at the same time, his two translators must
acknowledge, that the Sixth Book is the most correct
of the whole &AElig;ne&iuml;s. Oh! how convenient is
a machine sometimes in a heroic poem! This of
Mercury is plainly one; and Virgil was constrained
to use it here, or the honesty of his hero would be
ill-defended. And the fair sex, however, if they
had the deserter in their power, would certainly
have shewn him no more mercy than the Bacchanals
did Orpheus: for, if too much constancy may
be a fault sometimes, then want of constancy, and
ingratitude after the last favour, is a crime that
never will be forgiven. But, of machines, more in
their proper place; where I shall shew, with how
much judgment they have been used by Virgil;
and, in the mean time, pass to another article of
his defence, on the present subject; where, if I cannot
clear the hero, I hope at least to bring off the
poet; for here I must divide their causes. Let
&AElig;neas trust to his machine, which will only help
to break his fall; but the address is incomparable.
Plato, who borrowed so much from Homer, and yet
concluded for the banishment of all poets, would at
least have rewarded Virgil, before he sent him into
exile. But I go farther, and say, that he ought to
be acquitted, and deserved, beside, the bounty of
Augustus, and the gratitude of the Roman people.
If, after this, the ladies will stand out, let them remember,
that the jury is not all agreed; for Octavia
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
was of his party, and was of the first quality in
Rome; she was also present at the reading of the
Sixth &AElig;ne&iuml;d: and we know not that she condemned
&AElig;neas; but we are sure she presented the poet,
for his admirable elegy on her son Marcellus.</p>

<p>But let us consider the secret reasons which Virgil
had, for thus framing this noble episode, wherein
the whole passion of love is more exactly described
than in any other poet. Love was the theme
of his Fourth Book; and, though it is the shortest
of the whole &AElig;ne&iuml;s, yet there he has given its beginning,
its progress, its traverses, and its conclusion;
and had exhausted so entirely this subject,
that he could resume it but very slightly in the
eight ensuing books.</p>

<p>She was warmed with the graceful appearance of
the hero; she smothered those sparkles out of decency;
but conversation blew them up into a flame.
Then she was forced to make a confident of her
whom she best might trust, her own sister, who approves
the passion, and thereby augments it; then
succeeds her public owning it; and, after that, the
consummation. Of Venus and Juno, Jupiter and
Mercury, I say nothing; for they were all machining
work; but, possession having cooled his love,
as it increased hers, she soon perceived the change,
or at least grew suspicious of a change; this suspicion
soon turned to jealousy, and jealousy to rage;
then she disdains and threatens, and again is humble,
and entreats, and, nothing availing, despairs, curses,
and at last becomes her own executioner. See here
the whole process of that passion, to which nothing
can be added. I dare go no farther, lest I
should lose the connection of my discourse.<a id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>To love our native country, and to study its
benefit and its glory, to be interested in its concerns,
is natural to all men, and is indeed our common
duty. A poet makes a farther step; for, endeavouring
to do honour to it, it is allowable in him
even to be partial in its cause; for he is not tied to
truth, or fettered by the laws of history. Homer
and Tasso are justly praised for chusing their heroes
out of Greece and Italy; Virgil indeed made his a
Trojan; but it was to derive the Romans and his
own Augustus from him. But all the three poets
are manifestly partial to their heroes, in favour of
their country; for Dares Phrygius reports of Hector,
that he was slain cowardly: &AElig;neas, according
to the best account, slew not Mezentius, but was
slain by him; and the chronicles of Italy tell us
little of that Rinaldo d'Este, who conquers Jerusalem
in Tasso. He might be a champion of the
church; but we know not that he was so much as
present at the siege. To apply this to Virgil, he
thought himself engaged in honour to espouse the
cause and quarrel of his country against Carthage.
He knew he could not please the Romans better, or
oblige them more to patronize his poem, than by
disgracing the foundress of that city. He shews
her ungrateful to the memory of her first husband,
doting on a stranger; enjoyed, and afterwards forsaken,
by him. This was the original, says he, of
the immortal hatred betwixt the two rival nations.
It is true, he colours the falsehood of &AElig;neas by an
express command from Jupiter, to forsake the
queen, who had obliged him; but he knew the
Romans were to be his readers; and them he bribed,
perhaps at the expence of his hero's honesty;
but he gained his cause, however, as pleading before
corrupt judges. They were content to see their
founder false to love; for still he had the advantage
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
of the amour; it was their enemy whom he
forsook; and she might have forsaken him, if he
had not got the start of her; she had already forgotten
her vows to her Sich&aelig;us; and <i>varium et mutabile
semper femina</i>, is the sharpest satire, in the
fewest words, that ever was made on woman-kind;
for both the adjectives are neuter, and <i>animal</i> must
be understood, to make them grammar. Virgil does
well to put those words into the mouth of Mercury.
If a god had not spoken them, neither durst he have
written them, nor I translated them. Yet the deity
was forced to come twice on the same errand; and
the second time, as much a hero as &AElig;neas was,
he frighted him. It seems he feared not Jupiter so
much as Dido; for your lordship may observe, that,
as much intent as he was upon his voyage, yet he
still delayed it, till the messenger was obliged to
tell him plainly, that, if he weighed not anchor in
the night, the queen would be with him in the
morning&mdash;<i>notumque, furens quid femina possit</i>&mdash;she
was injured; she was revengeful; she was powerful.
The poet had likewise before hinted, that the
people were naturally perfidious; for he gives their
character in the queen, and makes a proverb of
<i>Punica fides</i>, many ages before it was invented.</p>

<p>Thus, I hope, my lord, that I have made good
my promise, and justified the poet, whatever becomes
of the false knight. And sure a poet is as
much privileged to lie as an ambassador, for the
honour and interest of his country; at least as Sir
Henry Wotton has defined.<a id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>This naturally leads me to the defence of the
famous anachronism, in making &AElig;neas and Dido
contemporaries; for it is certain, that the hero
lived almost two hundred years before the building
of Carthage. One who imitates Boccalini, says,
that Virgil was accused before Apollo for this error.
The god soon found, that he was not able to defend
his favourite by reason; for the case was clear: he
therefore gave this middle sentence, that any thing
might be allowed to his son Virgil, on the account
of his other merits; that, being a monarch, he had
a dispensing power, and pardoned him. But, that
this special act of grace might never be drawn into
example, or pleaded by his puny successors in justification
of their ignorance, he decreed for the future,
no poet should presume to make a lady die for
love two hundred years before her birth. To moralize
this story, Virgil is the Apollo who has this
dispensing power. His great judgment made the
laws of poetry; but he never made himself a slave
to them; chronology, at best, is but a cobweb-law,
and he broke through it with his weight. They who
will imitate him wisely, must chuse, as he did, an
obscure and a remote &aelig;ra, where they may invent
at pleasure, and not be easily contradicted. Neither
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
he, nor the Romans, had ever read the Bible, by
which only his false computation of times can be
made out against him. This S&eacute;grais says in his
defence, and proves it from his learned friend Bochartus,
whose letter on this subject he has printed
at the end of the fourth &AElig;ne&iuml;d, to which I refer
your lordship and the reader. Yet the credit of
Virgil was so great, that he made this fable of his
own invention pass for an authentic history, or at
least as credible as any thing in Homer. Ovid takes
it up after him, even in the same age, and makes
an ancient heroine of Virgil's new-created Dido;
dictates a letter for her, just before her death, to the
ungrateful fugitive; and, very unluckily for himself,
is for measuring a sword with a man so much
superior in force to him, on the same subject. I
think I may be judge of this, because I have translated
both.<a id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> The famous author of the "Art of
Love" has nothing of his own; he borrows all from
a greater master in his own profession; and, which
is worse, improves nothing which he finds. Nature
fails him; and, being forced to his old shift, he has
recourse to witticism. This passes indeed with his
soft admirers, and gives him the preference to Virgil
in their esteem. But let them like for themselves,
and not prescribe to others; for our author
needs not their admiration.</p>

<p>The motives that induced Virgil to coin this
fable, I have shewed already; and have also begun
to shew, that he might make this anachronism,
by superseding the mechanic rules of poetry,
for the same reason that a monarch may dispense
with or suspend his own laws, when he finds it necessary
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
so to do, especially if those laws are not altogether
fundamental. Nothing is to be called a
fault in poetry, says Aristotle, but what is against
the art; therefore a man may be an admirable poet,
without being an exact chronologer. Shall we dare,
continues S&eacute;grais, to condemn Virgil for having made
a fiction against the order of time, when we commend
Ovid and other poets, who have made many of
their fictions against the order of nature? For what
else are the splendid miracles of the Metamorphoses?
Yet these are beautiful as they are related, and have
also deep learning and instructive mythologies couched
under them: but to give, as Virgil does in this
episode, the original cause of the long wars betwixt
Rome and Carthage, to draw truth out of fiction
after so probable a manner, with so much beauty,
and so much for the honour of his country, was
proper only to the divine wit of Maro; and Tasso,
in one of his discourses, admires him for this particularly.
It is not lawful, indeed, to contradict a
point of history which is known to all the world,
as, for example, to make Hannibal and Scipio contemporaries
with Alexander; but, in the dark recesses
of antiquity, a great poet may and ought to
feign such things as he finds not there, if they can
be brought to embellish that subject which he
treats. On the other side, the pains and diligence
of ill poets is but thrown away, when they want
the genius to invent and feign agreeably. But, if
the fictions be delightful, (which they always are, if
they be natural,) if they be of a piece; if the beginning,
the middle, and the end, be in their due
places, and artfully united to each other, such
works can never fail of their deserved success. And
such is Virgil's episode of Dido and &AElig;neas; where
the sourest critic must acknowledge, that, if he
had deprived his &AElig;ne&iuml;s of so great an ornament
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
because he found no traces of it in antiquity, he had
avoided their unjust censure, but had wanted one
of the greatest beauties of his poem. I shall say
more of this in the next article of their charge
against him, which is want of invention. In the
mean time, I may affirm, in honour of this episode,
that it is not only now esteemed the most pleasing
entertainment of the &AElig;ne&iuml;s, but was so accounted
in his own age, and before it was mellowed into
that reputation which time has given it; for which
I need produce no other testimony, than that of
Ovid, his contemporary&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Nec pars ulla magis legitur de corpore toto,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i2"><i>Quam non legitimo f&oelig;dere junctus amor&mdash;</i></span>
</div></div>

<p>where, by the way, you may observe, my lord,
that Ovid, in those words, <i>Non legitimo f&oelig;dere junctus
amor</i>, will by no means allow it to be a lawful
marriage betwixt Dido and &AElig;neas. He was in
banishment when he wrote those verses, which I
cite from his letter to Augustus: "You, Sir," saith
he, "have sent me into exile for writing my 'Art
of Love,' and my wanton Elegies; yet your own
poet was happy in your good graces, though he
brought Dido and &AElig;neas into a cave, and left them
there not over-honestly together. May I be so bold
to ask your majesty, is it a greater fault to teach
the art of unlawful love, than to shew it in the action?"
But was Ovid, the court-poet, so bad a courtier,
as to find no other plea to excuse himself, than
by a plain accusation of his master? Virgil confessed
it was a lawful marriage betwixt the lovers,
that Juno the goddess of matrimony had ratified it
by her presence; for it was her business to bring
matters to that issue. That the ceremonies were
short, we may believe; for Dido was not only
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
amorous, but a widow. Mercury himself, though
employed on a quite contrary errand, yet owns it a
marriage by an inuendo&mdash;<i>pulchramque uxorius urbem
exstruis</i>. He calls &AElig;neas not only a husband,
but upbraids him for being a fond husband, as the
word <i>uxorius</i> implies. Now mark a little, if your
lordship pleases, why Virgil is so much concerned
to make this marriage (for he seems to be the father
of the bride himself, and to give her to the bridegroom);
It was to make way for the divorce which
he intended afterwards; for he was a finer flatterer
than Ovid; and I more than conjecture, that he
had in his eye the divorce which not long before
had passed betwixt the emperor and Scribonia.<a id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
He drew this dimple in the cheek of &AElig;neas, to
prove Augustus of the same family, by so remarkable
a feature in the same place. Thus, as we say
in our home-spun English proverb, he killed two
birds with one stone; pleased the emperor, by giving
him the resemblance of his ancestor, and gave
him such a resemblance as was not scandalous in
that age. For, to leave one wife, and take another,
was but a matter of gallantry at that time of day
among the Romans. <i>Neque h&aelig;c in f&oelig;dera veni</i>,
is the very excuse which &AElig;neas makes, when he
leaves his lady: "I made no such bargain with
you at our marriage, to live always drudging on at
Carthage: my business was Italy; and I never
made a secret of it. If I took my pleasure, had not
you your share of it? I leave you free, at my departure,
to comfort yourself with the next stranger
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
who happens to be shipwrecked on your coast. Be
as kind a hostess as you have been to me; and you
can never fail of another husband. In the mean
time, I call the gods to witness, that I leave your
shore unwillingly; for, though Juno made the
marriage, yet Jupiter commands me to forsake you."
This is the effect of what he saith, when it is dishonoured
out of Latin verse, into English prose.
If the poet argued not aright, we must pardon
him for a poor blind heathen, who knew no better
morals.</p>

<p>I have detained your lordship longer than I intended,
on this objection, which would indeed
weigh something in a spiritual court; but I am
not to defend our poet there. The next, I think,
is but a cavil, though the cry is great against him,
and hath continued from the time of Macrobius to
this present age. I hinted it before. They lay no
less than want of invention to his charge&mdash;a capital
crime, I must acknowledge; for a poet is a
maker,<a id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> as the word signifies; and he, who cannot
make, that is, invent, hath his name for nothing.
That which makes this accusation look so strange<a id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a>
at the first sight, is, that he has borrowed so many
things from Homer, Apollonius Rhodius, and others
who preceded him. But, in the first place, if invention
is to be taken in so strict a sense, that the
matter of a poem must be wholly new, and that in
all its parts, then Scaliger hath made out, saith
S&eacute;grais, that the history of Troy was no more the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
invention of Homer, than of Virgil. There was
not an old woman, or almost a child, but had it
in their mouths, before the Greek poet or his friends
digested it into this admirable order in which we
read it. At this rate, as Solomon hath told us,
there is nothing new beneath the sun. Who then
can pass for an inventor, if Homer, as well as Virgil,
must be deprived of that glory? Is Versailles
the less a new building, because the architect of
that palace hath imitated others which were built
before it? Walls, doors, and windows, apartments,
offices, rooms of convenience and magnificence, are
in all great houses. So descriptions, figures, fables,
and the rest, must be in all heroic poems; they
are the common materials of poetry, furnished
from the magazine of nature; every poet hath as
much right to them, as every man hath to air or
water.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Quid prohibetis aquas? Usus communis aquarum est.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But the argument of the work, that is to say, its
principal action, the &oelig;conomy and disposition of it;
these are the things which distinguish copies from
originals. The poet, who borrows nothing from
others, is yet to be born; he and the Jews' Messias
will come together. There are parts of the &AElig;ne&iuml;s,
which resemble some parts both of the Ilias and of
the Odysses; as, for example, &AElig;neas descended into
hell, and Ulysses had been there before him;
&AElig;neas loved Dido, and Ulysses loved Calypso; in
few words, Virgil hath imitated Homer's Odysses
in his first six books, and, in his six last, the Ilias.
But from hence can we infer, that the two poets
write the same history? Is there no invention in
some other parts of Virgil's &AElig;ne&iuml;s? The disposition
of so many various matters, is not that his own?
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
From what book of Homer had Virgil his episode
of Nisus and Euryalus, of Mezentius and Lausus?
From whence did he borrow his design of bringing
&AElig;neas into Italy? of establishing the Roman empire
on the foundations of a Trojan colony? to say
nothing of the honour he did his patron, not only
in his descent from Venus, but in making him so
like her in his best features, that the goddess might
have mistaken Augustus for her son. He had indeed
the story from common fame, as Homer had
his from the Egyptian priestess. <i>&AElig;nead&ucirc;m genetrix</i>
was no more unknown to Lucretius, than to him.
But Lucretius taught him not to form his hero, to
give him piety or valour for his manners, and both
in so eminent a degree, that, having done what was
possible for man to save his king and country, his
mother was forced to appear to him, and restrain
his fury, which hurried him to death in their revenge.
But the poet made his piety more successful;
he brought off his father and his son; and his
gods witnessed to his devotion, by putting themselves
under his protection, to be replaced by him
in their promised Italy. Neither the invention nor
the conduct of this great action were owing to Homer,
or any other poet. It is one thing to copy,
and another thing to imitate from nature. The
copier is that servile imitator, to whom Horace
gives no better a name than that of animal; he will
not so much as allow him to be a man. Raphael
imitated nature; they who copy one of Raphael's
pieces, imitate but him; for his work is their original.
They translate him, as I do Virgil; and fall
as short of him, as I of Virgil. There is a kind of
invention in the imitation of Raphael; for, though
the thing was in nature, yet the idea of it was his
own. Ulysses travelled; so did &AElig;neas: but neither
of them were the first travellers; for Cain went
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
into the land of Nod before they were born: and
neither of the poets ever heard of such a man. If
Ulysses had been killed at Troy, yet &AElig;neas must
have gone to sea, or he could never have arrived in
Italy. But the designs of the two poets were as
different as the courses of their heroes; one went
home, and the other sought a home. To return to
my first similitude: suppose Apelles and Raphael
had each of them painted a burning Troy, might
not the modern painter have succeeded as well as
the ancient, though neither of them had seen the
town on fire? for the draughts of both were taken
from the ideas which they had of nature. Cities
had been burnt, before either of them were in being.
But, to close the simile as I began it; they
would not have designed it after the same manner:
Apelles would have distinguished Pyrrhus from the
rest of all the Grecians, and shewed him forcing his
entrance into Priam's palace; there he had set him
in the fairest light, and given him the chief place
of all his figures; because he was a Grecian, and he
would do honour to his country. Raphael, who
was an Italian, and descended from the Trojans,
would have made &AElig;neas the hero of his piece; and
perhaps not with his father on his back, his son in
one hand, his bundle of gods in the other, and his
wife following; for an act of piety is not half so
graceful in a picture, as an act of courage: he
would rather have drawn him killing Androgeos, or
some other, hand to hand; and the blaze of the
fires should have darted full upon his face, to make
him conspicuous amongst his Trojans. This, I think,
is a just comparison betwixt the two poets, in the
conduct of their several designs. Virgil cannot be
said to copy Homer; the Grecian had only the advantage
of writing first. If it be urged, that I have
granted a resemblance in some parts, yet therein
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
Virgil has excelled him. For, what are the tears of
Calypso for being left, to the fury and death of
Dido? Where is there the whole process of her passion,
and all its violent effects to be found, in the
languishing episode of the Odysses? If this be to
copy, let the critics shew us the same dispositions,
features, or colouring, in their original. The like
may be said of the descent to hell, which was not
of Homer's invention neither; he had it from the
story of Orpheus and Eurydice. But to what end
did Ulysses make that journey? &AElig;neas undertook
it by the express commandment of his father's
ghost; there he was to show him all the succeeding
heroes of his race, and, next to Romulus, (mark,
if you please, the address of Virgil,) his own patron,
Augustus C&aelig;sar. Anchises was likewise to instruct
him, how to manage the Italian war, and how to
conclude it with his honour; that is, in other words,
to lay the foundations of that empire which Augustus
was to govern. This is the noble invention of
our author; but it hath been copied by so many
sign-post daubers, that now it is grown fulsome,
rather by their want of skill, than by the commonness.</p>

<p>In the last place, I may safely grant, that, by
reading Homer, Virgil was taught to imitate his
invention&mdash;that is, to imitate like him; which is
no more than if a painter studied Raphael, that he
might learn to design after his manner. And thus
I might imitate Virgil, if I were capable of writing
a heroic poem, and yet the invention be my own:
but I should endeavour to avoid a servile copying.
I would not give the same story under other names,
with the same characters, in the same order, and
with the same sequel; for every common reader to
find me out at the first sight for a plagiary, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
cry,&mdash;This I read before in Virgil, in a better language,
and in better verse. This is like Merry Andrew
on the low rope, copying lubberly the same
tricks which his master is so dexterously performing
on the high.</p>

<p>I will trouble your lordship but with one objection
more, which I know not whether I found in Le
F&egrave;vre, or Valais; but I am sure I have read it in
another French critic, whom I will not name, because
I think it is not much for his reputation.<a id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>
Virgil, in the heat of action&mdash;suppose, for example,
in describing the fury of his hero in a battle,
when he is endeavouring to raise our concernments
to the highest pitch&mdash;turns short on the sudden into
some similitude, which diverts, say they, your
attention from the main subject, and mis spends
it on some trivial image. He pours cold water
into the cauldron, when his business is to make it
boil.<a id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>This accusation is general against all who would
be thought heroic poets; but I think it touches
Virgil less than any. He is too great a master of
his art, to make a blot which may so easily be
hit. Similitudes, as I have said, are not for tragedy,
which is all violent, and where the passions
are in a perpetual ferment; for there they deaden
where they should animate; they are not of the nature
of dialogue, unless in comedy: a metaphor is
almost all the stage can suffer, which is a kind of
similitude comprehended in a word. But this figure
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
has a contrary effect in heroic poetry; there it is
employed to raise the admiration, which is its proper
business; and admiration is not of so violent a
nature as fear or hope, compassion or horror, or any
concernment we can have for such or such a person
on the stage. Not but I confess, that similitudes
and descriptions, when drawn into an unreasonable
length, must needs nauseate the reader. Once, I
remember, and but once, Virgil makes a similitude
of fourteen lines; and his description of Fame is
about the same number. He is blamed for both;
and I doubt not but he would have contracted
them, had he lived to have reviewed his work; but
faults are no precedents. This I have observed of
his similitudes in general, that they are not placed,
as our unobserving critics tell us, in the heat of
any action, but commonly in its declining. When
he has warmed us in his description as much as
possibly he can, then, lest that warmth should languish,
he renews it by some apt similitude, which
illustrates his subject, and yet palls not his audience.
I need give your lordship but one example
of this kind, and leave the rest to your observation,
when next you review the whole &AElig;ne&iuml;s in the original,
unblemished by my rude translation. It is in
the first book, where the poet describes Neptune
composing the ocean, on which &AElig;olus had raised a
tempest without his permission. He had already
chidden the rebellious winds for obeying the commands
of their usurping master; he had warned them
from the seas; he had beaten down the billows with
his mace, dispelled the clouds, restored the sunshine,
while Triton and Cymotho&euml; were heaving
the ships from off the quick-sands, before the poet
would offer at a similitude for illustration:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Ac, veluti magno in populo cum s&aelig;pe coorta est</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Seditio, s&aelig;vitque animis ignobile vulgus,</i></span>


<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Jamque faces et saxa volant; furor arma ministrat;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Tum, pietate gravem ac meritis si forte virum quem</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Conspexere, silent, arrectisque auribus adstant;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ille regit dictis animos, et pectora mulcet:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sic cunctus pelagi cecidit fragor, &aelig;quora postquam</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Prospiciens genitor, c&aelig;loque invectus aperto,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Flectit equos, curr&ucirc;que volans dat lora secundo.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is the first similitude which Virgil makes in
this poem, and one of the longest in the whole;
for which reason I the rather cite it. While the
storm was in its fury, any allusion had been improper;
for the poet could have compared it to nothing
more impetuous than itself; consequently he
could have made no illustration. If he could have
illustrated, it had been an ambitious ornament out
of season, and would have diverted our concernment:
<i>nunc non erat his locus</i>; and therefore he
deferred it to its proper place.<a id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p>These are the criticisms of most moment which
have been made against the &AElig;ne&iuml;s by the ancients
or moderns. As for the particular exceptions against
this or that passage, Macrobius and Pontanus have
answered them already. If I desired to appear
more learned than I am, it had been as easy for me
to have taken their objections and solutions, as it is
for a country parson to take the expositions of the
fathers out of Junius and Tremellius,<a id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> and not to
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
have named the authors from whence I had them;
for so Ru&aelig;us, otherwise a most judicious commentator
on Virgil's works, has used Pontanus, his
greatest benefactor; of whom he is very silent;
and I do not remember that he once cites him.</p>

<p>What follows next, is no objection; for that implies
a fault: and it had been none in Virgil, if he
had extended the time of his action beyond a year.
At least Aristotle has set no precise limits to it.
Homer's, we know, was within two months: Tasso,
I am sure, exceeds not a summer; and, if I examined
him, perhaps he might be reduced into a
much less compass. Bossu leaves it doubtful whether
Virgil's action were within the year, or took up
some months beyond it. Indeed, the whole dispute
is of no more concernment to the common reader,
than it is to a ploughman, whether February
this year had 28 or 29 days in it. But, for the satisfaction
of the more curious, (of which number I
am sure your lordship is one,) I will translate what
I think convenient out of S&eacute;grais, whom perhaps
you have not read; for he has made it highly probable,
that the action of the &AElig;ne&iuml;s began in the
spring, and was not extended beyond the autumn.
And we have known campaigns that have begun
sooner, and have ended later.</p>

<p>Ronsard, and the rest whom S&eacute;grais names, who
are of opinion, that the action of this poem takes
up almost a year and half, ground their calculation
thus. Anchises died in Sicily at the end of winter,
or beginning of the spring. &AElig;neas, immediately
after the interment of his father, puts to sea for
Italy. He is surprised by the tempest described
in the beginning of the first book; and there it
is that the scene of the poem opens, and where
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
the action must commence. He is driven by this
storm on the coasts of Afric; he stays at Carthage
all that summer, and almost all the winter following,
sets sail again for Italy just before the beginning
of the spring, meets with contrary winds,
and makes Sicily the second time. This part of the
action completes the year. Then he celebrates the
anniversary of his father's funeral, and shortly after
arrives at Cum&aelig;; and from thence his time is
taken up in his first treaty with Latinus, the overture
of the war, the siege of his camp by Turnus,
his going for succours to relieve it, his return, the
raising of the siege by the first battle, the twelve
days' truce, the second battle, the assault of Laurentum,
and the single fight with Turnus; all which,
they say, cannot take up less than four or five
months more; by which account, we cannot suppose
the entire action to be contained in a much
less compass than a year and half.</p>

<p>S&eacute;grais reckons another way; and his computation
is not condemned by the learned Ru&aelig;us, who
compiled and published the commentaries on our
poet, which we call the Dauphin's Virgil.</p>

<p>He allows the time of the year when Anchises
died to be in the latter end of winter, or the beginning
of the spring: he acknowledges, that, when
&AElig;neas is first seen at sea afterwards, and is driven
by the tempest on the coast of Afric, is the time
when the action is naturally to begin: he confesses,
further, that &AElig;neas left Carthage in the latter end
of winter; for Dido tells him in express terms, as
an argument for his longer stay,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Quinetiam hiberno moliris sidere classem.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But, whereas Ronsard's followers suppose, that,
when &AElig;neas had buried his father, he set sail immediately
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
for Italy, (though the tempest drove him
on the coast of Carthage,) S&eacute;grais will by no means
allow that supposition, but thinks it much more
probable, that he remained in Sicily till the midst of
July, or the beginning of August; at which time
he places the first appearance of his hero on the sea;
and there opens the action of the poem. From
which beginning, to the death of Turnus, which
concludes the action, there need not be supposed
above ten months of intermediate time: for, arriving
at Carthage in the latter end of summer, staying
there the winter following, departing thence in
the very beginning of the spring, making a short
abode in Sicily the second time, landing in Italy,
and making the war, may be reasonably judged the
business but of ten months. To this the Ronsardians
reply, that, having been for seven years before
in quest of Italy, and having no more to do in
Sicily than to inter his father&mdash;after that office was
performed, what remained for him, but, without delay,
to pursue his first adventure? To which S&eacute;grais
answers, that the obsequies of his father, according
to the rites of the Greeks and Romans, would detain
him for many days; that a longer time must
be taken up in the refitting of his ships after so tedious
a voyage, and in refreshing his weather-beaten
soldiers on a friendly coast. These indeed are but
suppositions on both sides; yet those of S&eacute;grais seem
better grounded: for the feast of Dido, when she
entertained &AElig;neas first, has the appearance of a
summer's night, which seems already almost ended,
when he begins his story; therefore the love was
made in autumn: the hunting followed properly
when the heats of that scorching country were declining;
the winter was passed in jollity, as the season
and their love required; and he left her in the
latter end of winter, as is already proved. This
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
opinion is fortified by the arrival of &AElig;neas at the
mouth of Tyber; which marks the season of the
spring; that season being perfectly described by
the singing of the birds saluting the dawn, and by
the beauty of the place, which the poet seems to
have painted expressly in the seventh &AElig;neid:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Aurora in roseis fulgebat lutea bigis,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Cum venti posuere.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Vari&aelig;, circumque supraque,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Assuet&aelig; ripis volucres, et fluminis alveo,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>&AElig;thera mulcebant cantu.</i>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The remainder of the action required but three
months more: for, when &AElig;neas went for succour to
the Tuscans, he found their army in a readiness to
march, and wanting only a commander: so that,
according to this calculation, the &AElig;ne&iuml;s takes not
up above a year complete, and may be comprehended
in less compass.</p>

<p>This, amongst other circumstances treated more
at large by S&eacute;grais, agrees with the rising of Orion,
which caused the tempest described in the beginning
of the First Book. By some passages in the
"Pastorals," but more particularly in the "Georgics,"
our poet is found to be an exact astronomer, according
to the knowledge of that age. Now Ilioneus
(whom Virgil twice employs in embassies, as the
best speaker of the Trojans) attributes that tempest
to Orion, in his speech to Dido:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Cum, subito assurgens fluctu, nimbosus Orion</i>&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He must mean either the heliacal, or achronical rising
of that sign. The heliacal rising of a constellation
is, when it comes from under the rays of the
sun, and begins to appear before day-light; the
achronical rising, on the contrary, is when it appears
at the close of day, and in opposition to the
sun's diurnal course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>The heliacal rising of Orion is at present computed
to be about the sixth of July; and about that
time it is, that he either causes or presages tempests
on the seas.</p>

<p>S&eacute;grais has observed farther, that, when Anna
counsels Dido to stay &AElig;neas during the winter, she
speaks also of Orion&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Dum pelago des&aelig;vit hiems, et aquosus Orion.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If therefore Ilioneus, according to our supposition,
understand the heliacal rising of Orion, Anna
must mean the achronical, which the different epithets
given to that constellation seem to manifest.
Ilioneus calls him <i>nimbosus</i>; Anna, <i>aquosus</i>. He is
tempestuous in the summer, when he rises heliacally,
and rainy in the winter, when he rises achronically.
Your lordship will pardon me for the frequent repetition
of these cant words, which I could not avoid
in this abbreviation of S&eacute;grais, who, I think, deserves
no little commendation in this new criticism.<a id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a></p>

<p>I have yet a word or two to say of Virgil's machines,
from my own observation of them. He has
imitated those of Homer, but not copied them. It
was established, long before this time, in the Roman
religion as well as in the Greek, that there were
gods; and both nations, for the most part, worshipped
the same deities; as did also the Trojans, from
whom the Romans, I suppose, would rather be
thought to derive the rites of their religion, than
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
from the Grecians; because they thought themselves
descended from them. Each of those gods
had his proper office, and the chief of them their
particular attendants. Thus Jupiter had in propriety
Ganymede and Mercury, and Juno had Iris. It
was not for Virgil then to create new ministers:
he must take what he found in his religion. It
cannot therefore be said, that he borrowed them
from Homer, any more than Apollo, Diana, and the
rest, whom he uses as he finds occasion for them, as
the Grecian poet did; but he invents the occasions
for which he uses them. Venus, after the destruction
of Troy, had gained Neptune entirely to her
party; therefore we find him busy in the beginning
of the &AElig;ne&iuml;s, to calm the tempest raised by &AElig;olus,
and afterwards conducting the Trojan fleet to Cum&aelig;
in safety, with the loss only of their pilot, for whom
he bargains. I name those two examples (amongst
a hundred which I omit) to prove, that Virgil, generally
speaking, employed his machines in performing
those things which might possibly have
been done without them. What more frequent
than a storm at sea, upon the rising of Orion? What
wonder, if, amongst so many ships, there should one
be overset, which was commanded by Orontes,
though half the winds had not been there which
&AElig;olus employed? Might not Palinurus, without a
miracle, fall asleep, and drop into the sea, having
been over-wearied with watching, and secure of a
quiet passage, by his observation of the skies? At
least &AElig;neas, who knew nothing of the machine of
Somnus, takes it plainly in this sense:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>O nimium c&aelig;lo et pelago confise sereno,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Nudus in ignot&acirc;, Palinure, jacebis aren&acirc;</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But machines sometimes are specious things to
amuse the reader, and give a colour of probability
to things otherwise incredible. And, besides, it
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
soothed the vanity of the Romans, to find the gods
so visibly concerned in all the actions of their predecessors.
We, who are better taught by our religion,
yet own every wonderful accident, which befals
us for the best, to be brought to pass by some
special providence of Almighty God, and by the
care of guardian angels: and from hence I might
infer, that no heroic poem can be writ on the Epicurean
principles; which I could easily demonstrate,
if there were need to prove it, or I had leisure.<a id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>When Venus opens the eyes of her son &AElig;neas,
to behold the gods who combated against Troy in
that fatal night when it was surprised, we share the
pleasure of that glorious vision, (which Tasso has
not ill copied in the sacking of Jerusalem.) But the
Greeks had done their business, though neither
Neptune, Juno, nor Pallas, had given them their divine
assistance. The most crude machine which
Virgil uses, is in the episode of Camilla, where
Opis, by the command of her mistress, kills Aruns.
The next is in the twelfth &AElig;ne&iuml;d, where Venus
cures her son &AElig;neas. But, in the last of these, the
poet was driven to a necessity; for Turnus was to
be slain that very day; and &AElig;neas, wounded as he
was, could not have engaged him in single combat,
unless his hurt had been miraculously healed. And
the poet had considered, that the dittany which she
brought from Crete, could not have wrought so
speedy an effect, without the juice of ambrosia,
which she mingled with it. After all, that his
machine might not seem too violent, we see the
hero limping after Turnus. The wound was skinned;
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
but the strength of his thigh was not restored.
But what reason had our author to wound
&AElig;neas at so critical a time? and how came the
cuisses to be worse tempered than the rest of his
armour, which was all wrought by Vulcan and his
journeymen? These difficulties are not easily to be
solved, without confessing that Virgil had not life
enough to correct his work; though he had reviewed
it, and found those errors, which he resolved to
mend: but, being prevented by death, and not willing
to leave an imperfect work behind him, he ordained,
by his last testament, that his &AElig;ne&iuml;s should
be burned. As for the death of Aruns, who was
shot by a goddess, the machine was not altogether
so outrageous, as the wounding Mars and Venus by
the sword of Diomede. Two divinities, one would
have thought, might have pleaded their prerogative
of impassibility, or at least not have been wounded
by any mortal hand; beside that the &#953;&#967;&#969;&#961;, which
they shed, was so very like our common blood, that
it was not to be distinguished from it, but only by
the name and colour. As for what Horace says in
his Art of Poetry, that no machines are to be used,
unless on some extraordinary occasion,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Nec deus intersit, nisi dignus vindice nodus</i>&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>that rule is to be applied to the theatre, of which
he is then speaking; and means no more than this,
that, when the knot of the play is to be untied, and
no other way is left for making the discovery; then,
and not otherwise, let a god descend upon a rope,
and clear the business to the audience: but this has
no relation to the machines which are used in an
epic poem.</p>

<p>In the last place, for the Dira, or flying pest,
which, flapping on the shield of Turnus, and fluttering
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
about his head, disheartened him in the duel,
and presaged to him his approaching death, I might
have placed it more properly amongst the objections:
for the critics, who lay want of courage to
the charge of Virgil's hero, quote this passage as a
main proof of their assertion. They say our author
had not only secured him before the duel, but also, in
the beginning of it, had given him the advantage
in impenetrable arms, and in his sword; for that of
Turnus was not his own, which was forged by Vulcan
for his father, but a weapon which he had
snatched in haste, and by mistake, belonging to his
charioteer Metiscus; that, after all this, Jupiter,
who was partial to the Trojan, and distrustful of
the event, though he had hung the balance, and
given it a jog of his hand to weigh down Turnus,
thought convenient to give the Fates a collateral security,
by sending the screech-owl to discourage
him: for which they quote these words of Virgil,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&mdash;&mdash;<i>Non me tua turbida virtus</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Terret, ait: d&icirc; me terrent, et Jupiter hostis</i>.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In answer to which, I say, that this machine is
one of those which the poet uses only for ornament,
and not out of necessity. Nothing can be
more beautiful or more poetical than his description
of the three Dir&aelig;, or the setting of the balance,
which our Milton has borrowed from him, but employed
to a different end: for, first, he makes God
Almighty set the scales for St Gabriel and Satan,
when he knew no combat was to follow; then he
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
makes the good angel's scale descend, and the Devil's
mount, quite contrary to Virgil, if I have
translated the three verses according to my author's
sense:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Jupiter ipse duas &aelig;quato examine lances</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sustinet; et fata imponit diversa duorum;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Quem damnet labor, et quo vergat pondere letum</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>for I have taken these words, <i>quem damnet labor</i>, in
the sense which Virgil gives them in another place,&mdash;<i>damnabis
tu quoque votis</i>,&mdash;to signify a prosperous
event. Yet I dare not condemn so great a genius
as Milton: for I am much mistaken if he alludes
not to the text in Daniel, where Belshazzar was put
into the balance, and found too light.&mdash;This is
digression; and I return to my subject. I said
above, that these two machines of the balance and
the Dira were only ornamental, and that the success
of the duel had been the same without them: for,
when &AElig;neas and Turnus stood fronting each other
before the altar, Turnus looked dejected, and his colour
faded in his face, as if he desponded of the victory
before the fight; and not only he, but all his
party, when the strength of the two champions was
judged by the proportion of their limbs, concluded
it was <i>impar pugna</i>, and that their chief was overmatched:
whereupon Juturna (who was of the same
opinion) took this opportunity to break the treaty
and renew the war. Juno herself had plainly told
the nymph beforehand, that her brother was to
fight</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Imparibus fatis, nec d&icirc;s nec viribus &aelig;quis</i>;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>so that there was no need of an apparition to fright
Turnus: he had the presage within himself of his
impending destiny. The Dira only served to confirm
him in his first opinion, that it was his destiny
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
to die in the ensuing combat; and in this sense are
those words of Virgil to be taken,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&mdash;&mdash;<i>Non me tua turbida virtus</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Terret, ait: d&icirc; me terrent, et Jupiter hostis</i>.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I doubt not but the adverb <i>solum</i> is to be understood;
"It is not your [valour] <i>only</i> that gives me
this concernment; but I find also, by this portent,
that Jupiter is my enemy:" for Turnus fled before,
when his first sword was broken, till his sister supplied
him with a better; which indeed he could
not use, because &AElig;neas kept him at a distance with
his spear. I wonder Ru&aelig;us saw not this, where he
charges his author so unjustly, for giving Turnus a
second sword to no purpose. How could he fasten
a blow, or make a thrust, when he was not suffered
to approach? Besides, the chief errand of the Dira
was to warn Juturna from the field; for she could
have brought the chariot again, when she saw her
brother worsted in the duel. I might farther add,
that &AElig;neas was so eager of the fight, that he left
the city, now almost in his possession, to decide his
quarrel with Turnus by the sword: whereas Turnus
had manifestly declined the combat, and suffered
his sister to convey him as far from the reach of his
enemy as she could&mdash;I say, not only suffered her,
but consented to it; for it is plain, he knew her, by
these words:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>O soror, et dudum agnovi, cum prima per artem</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>F&oelig;dera turb&acirc;sti, teque h&aelig;c in bella dedisti;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Et nunc necquidquam fallis dea</i>.&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>I have dwelt so long on this subject, that I must
contract what I have to say in reference to my
translation, unless I would swell my preface into a
volume, and make it formidable to your lordship,
when you see so many pages yet behind. And indeed
what I have already written, either in justification
or praise of Virgil, is against myself, for presuming
to copy, in my coarse English, the thoughts
and beautiful expressions of this inimitable poet,
who flourished in an age when his language was
brought to its last perfection, for which it was particularly
owing to him and Horace. I will give
your lordship my opinion, that those two friends
had consulted each other's judgment, wherein they
should endeavour to excel; and they seem to
have pitched on propriety of thought, elegance of
words, and harmony of numbers. According to
this model, Horace writ his Odes and Epodes: for
his Satires and Epistles, being intended wholly for
instruction, required another style&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Ornari res ipsa negat, contenta doceri</i>&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and therefore, as he himself professes, are <i>sermoni
propiora</i>, nearer prose than verse. But Virgil, who
never attempted the lyric verse, is everywhere elegant,
sweet, and flowing in his hexameters. His
words are not only chosen, but the places in which
he ranks them for the sound. He who removes
them from the station wherein their master set
them, spoils the harmony. What he says of the
Sibyl's prophecies, may be as properly applied to
every word of his: they must be read in order as
they lie; the least breath discomposes them; and
somewhat of their divinity is lost. I cannot boast
that I have been thus exact in my verses; but I
have endeavoured to follow the example of my master,
and am the first Englishman, perhaps, who made
it his design to copy him in his numbers, his choice
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
of words, and his placing them for the sweetness of
the sound. On this last consideration, I have shunned
the <i>c&aelig;sura</i> as much as possibly I could: for,
wherever that is used, it gives a roughness to the
verse; of which we can have little need in a language
which is overstocked with consonants.<a id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> Such is
not the Latin, where the vowels and consonants are
mixed in proportion to each other: yet Virgil judged
the vowels to have somewhat of an over-balance,
and therefore tempers their sweetness with <i>c&aelig;suras</i>.
Such difference there is in tongues, that the same
figure, which roughens one, gives majesty to another:
and that was it which Virgil studied in his
verses. Ovid uses it but rarely; and hence it is
that his versification cannot so properly be called
sweet, as luscious. The Italians are forced upon it
once or twice in every line, because they have a redundancy
of vowels in their language. Their metal
is so soft, that it will not coin without alloy to
harden it. On the other side, for the reason already
named, it is all we can do to give sufficient
sweetness to our language: we must not only chuse
our words for elegance, but for sound; to perform
which, a mastery in the language is required; the
poet must have a magazine of words, and have the
art to manage his few vowels to the best advantage,
that they may go the farther. He must also know
the nature of the vowels&mdash;which are more sonorous,
and which more soft and sweet&mdash;and so dispose
them as his present occasions require: all which,
and a thousand secrets of versification beside, he
may learn from Virgil, if he will take him for his
guide. If he be above Virgil, and is resolved to
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
follow his own <i>verve</i>, (as the French call it,) the proverb
will fall heavily upon him:&mdash;"Who teaches
himself, has a fool for his master."</p>

<p>Virgil employed eleven years upon his &AElig;ne&iuml;s;
yet he left it, as he thought himself, imperfect;
which when I seriously consider, I wish, that, instead
of three years which I have spent in the
translation of his works, I had four years more allowed
me to correct my errors, that I might make
my version somewhat more tolerable than it is: for
a poet cannot have too great a reverence for his readers,
if he expects his labours should survive him.
Yet I will neither plead my age nor sickness, in excuse
of the faults which I have made: that I wanted
time, is all that I have to say; for some of
my subscribers grew so clamorous, that I could no
longer defer the publication. I hope, from the
candour of your lordship, and your often experienced
goodness to me, that, if the faults are not too
many, you will make allowances with Horace:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;si <i>plura nitent in carmine, non ego paucis</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Offendar maculis, quas aut incuria fudit,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Aut humana parum cavit natura</i>.&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>You may please also to observe, that there is not,
to the best of my remembrance, one vowel gaping
on another for want of a <i>c&aelig;sura</i>, in this whole poem:
but, where a vowel ends a word, the next begins
either with a consonant, or what is its equivalent;
for our <i>W</i> and <i>H</i> aspirate, and our diphthongs, are
plainly such. The greatest latitude I take is in the
letter <i>Y</i>, when it concludes a word, and the first
syllable of the next begins with a vowel. Neither
need I have called this a latitude, which is only an
explanation of this general rule&mdash;that no vowel can
be cut off before another, when we cannot sink the
pronunciation of it; as <i>he</i>, <i>she</i>, <i>me</i>, <i>I</i>, &amp;c. Virgil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
thinks it sometimes a beauty to imitate the licence
of the Greeks, and leave two vowels opening on
each other, as in that verse of the Third Pastoral,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Et succus pecori, et lac subducitur agnis</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But, <i>nobis non licet esse tam disertis</i>, at least if we
study to refine our numbers. I have long had by
me the materials of an English <i>Prosodia</i>, containing
all the mechanical rules of versification, wherein I
have treated, with some exactness, of the feet, the
quantities, and the pauses. The French and Italians
know nothing of the two first; at least their
best poets have not practised them. As for the
pauses, Malherbe first brought them into France
within this last century; and we see how they
adorn their Alexandrines. But, as Virgil propounds
a riddle, which he leaves unsolved&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Dic, quibus in terris, inscripti nomina regum</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Nascantur flores; et Phyllida solus habeto</i>&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>so I will give your lordship another, and leave the
exposition of it to your acute judgment. I am
sure there are few who make verses, have observed
the sweetness of these two lines in Cooper's Hill:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Though deep, yet clear; though gentle, yet not dull;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strong without rage; without o'erflowing, full&mdash;<a id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and there are yet fewer who can find the reason of
that sweetness. I have given it to some of my
friends in conversation; and they have allowed the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
criticism to be just. But, since the evil of false
quantities is difficult to be cured in any modern
language; since the French and the Italians, as
well as we, are yet ignorant what feet are to be used
in heroic poetry; since I have not strictly observed
those rules myself, which I can teach others; since I
pretend to no dictatorship among my fellow-poets;
since, if I should instruct some of them to make
well-running verses, they want genius to give them
strength as well as sweetness; and, above all, since
your lordship has advised me not to publish that
little which I know, I look on your counsel as your
command, which I shall observe inviolably, till you
shall please to revoke it, and leave me at liberty to
make my thoughts public. In the mean time, that
I may arrogate nothing to myself, I must acknowledge
that Virgil in Latin, and Spenser in English,
have been my masters. Spenser has also given me
the boldness to make use sometimes of his Alexandrine
line, which we call, though improperly, the
Pindaric, because Mr Cowley has often employed
it in his Odes. It adds a certain majesty to the
verse, when it is used with judgment, and stops the
sense from overflowing into another line. Formerly
the French, like us, and the Italians, had but five
feet, or ten syllables, in their heroic verse; but,
since Ronsard's time, as I suppose, they found their
tongue too weak to support their epic poetry, without
the addition of another foot. That indeed has
given it somewhat of the run and measure of a trimeter;
but it runs with more activity than strength:
their language is not strung with sinews, like our
English; it has the nimbleness of a greyhound, but
not the bulk and body of a mastiff. Our men and
our verses overbear them by their weight; and
<i>Pondere, non numero</i>, is the British motto. The
French have set up purity for the standard of their
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
language; and a masculine vigour is that of ours.
Like their tongue, is the genius of their poets, light
and trifling in comparison of the English; more
proper for sonnets, madrigals, and elegies, than heroic
poetry. The turn on thoughts and words is
their chief talent; but the epic poem is too stately
to receive those little ornaments. The painters
draw their nymphs in thin and airy habits; but the
weight of gold and of embroideries is reserved for
queens and goddesses. Virgil is never frequent in
those turns, like Ovid, but much more sparing of
them in his &AElig;ne&iuml;s, than in his Pastorals and Georgics.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Ignoscenda quidem, scirent si ignoscere manes.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>That turn is beautiful indeed; but he employs
it in the story of Orpheus and Eurydice, not in his
great poem. I have used that licence in his &AElig;ne&iuml;s
sometimes; but I own it as my fault. It was given
to those who understand no better. It is like Ovid's</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Semivirumque bovem, semibovemque virum</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The poet found it before his critics, but it was a
darling sin, which he would not be persuaded to
reform. The want of genius, of which I have accused
the French, is laid to their charge by one of
their own great authors, though I have forgotten
his name, and where I read it. If rewards could
make good poets, their great master<a id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> has not been
wanting on his part in his bountiful encouragements:
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
for he is wise enough to imitate Augustus, if he
had a Maro. The triumvir and proscriber had descended
to us in a more hideous form than they now
appear, if the emperor had not taken care to make
friends of him and Horace. I confess, the banishment
of Ovid was a blot in his escutcheon: yet he
was only banished; and who knows but his crime
was capital, and then his exile was a favour? Ariosto,
who, with all his faults, must be acknowledged
a great poet, has put these words into the mouth
of an evangelist:<a id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> but whether they will pass for
gospel now, I cannot tell.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Non f&ugrave; si santo ni benigno Augusto,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Come la tuba di Virgilio suona.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>L'haver havuto in poesia buon gusto,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>La proscrittione iniqua gli perdona.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But heroic poetry is not of the growth of France,
as it might be of England, if it were cultivated.
Spenser wanted only to have read the rules of Bossu;
for no man was ever born with a greater genius,
or had more knowledge to support it. But the
performance of the French is not equal to their
skill; and hitherto we have wanted skill to perform
better. S&eacute;grais, whose preface is so wonderfully
good, yet is wholly destitute of elevation, though
his version is much better than that of the two brothers,
or any of the rest who have attempted Virgil.
Hannibal Caro is a great name amongst the Italians;
yet his translation of the &AElig;ne&iuml;s is most scandalously
mean, though he has taken the advantage of writing
in blank verse, and freed himself from the
shackles of modern rhyme, if it be modern; for Le
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
Clerc has told us lately, and I believe has made it
out, that David's Psalms were written in as errant
rhyme as they are translated. Now, if a Muse
cannot run when she is unfettered, it is a sign she
has but little speed. I will not make a digression
here, though I am strangely tempted to it; but will
only say, that he who can write well in rhyme, may
write better in blank verse.<a id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Rhyme is certainly
a constraint even to the best poets, and those who
make it with most ease; though perhaps I have as
little reason to complain of that hardship as any
man, excepting Quarles and Withers. What it adds
to sweetness, it takes away from sense; and he who
loses the least by it, may be called a gainer. It often
makes us swerve from an author's meaning; as,
if a mark be set up for an archer at a great distance,
let him aim as exactly as he can, the least wind will
take his arrow, and divert it from the white.&mdash;I return
to our Italian translator of the &AElig;ne&iuml;s. He is a
foot-poet, he lacquies by the side of Virgil at the
best, but never mounts behind him. Doctor Morelli,<a id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
who is no mean critic in our poetry, and
therefore may be presumed to be a better in his own
language, has confirmed me in this opinion by his
judgment, and thinks, withal, that he has often
mistaken his master's sense. I would say so, if I
durst, but am afraid I have committed the same
fault more often, and more grossly; for I have forsaken
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
Ru&aelig;us, (whom generally I follow,) in many
places, and made expositions of my own in some,
quite contrary to him; of which I will give but
two examples, because they are so near each other,
in the Tenth &AElig;neid&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">---- &mdash;&mdash;<i>Sorti Pater &aelig;quus utrique</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Pallas says it to Turnus, just before they fight.
Ru&aelig;us thinks that the word <i>Pater</i> is to be referred
to Evander, the father of Pallas. But how could
he imagine that it was the same thing to Evander,
if his son were slain, or if he overcame? The poet
certainly intended Jupiter, the common father of
mankind; who, as Pallas hoped, would stand an
impartial spectator of the combat, and not be more
favourable to Turnus than to him. The second is
not long after it, and both before the duel is begun.
They are the words of Jupiter, who comforts Hercules
for the death of Pallas, which was immediately
to ensue, and which Hercules could not hinder,
(though the young hero had addressed his prayers
to him for his assistance) because the gods cannot
controul destiny. The verse follows:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Sic ait; atque oculos Rutulorum rejicit arvis</i>,&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>which the same Ru&aelig;us thus construes: Jupiter, after
he had said this, immediately turns his eyes to
the Rutulian fields, and beholds the duel. I have
given this place another exposition, that he turned
his eyes from the field of combat, that he might not
behold a sight so unpleasing to him. The word <i>rejicit</i>,
I know, will admit of both senses; but Jupiter,
having confessed that he could not alter fate,
and being grieved he could not, in consideration of
Hercules&mdash;it seems to me that he should avert his
eyes, rather than take pleasure in the spectacle.
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
But of this I am not so confident as the other,
though I think I have followed Virgil's sense.<a id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>What I have said, though it has the face of arrogance,
yet is intended for the honour of my country;
and therefore I will boldly own, that this English
translation has more of Virgil's spirit in it, than
either the French or the Italian. Some of our countrymen
have translated episodes and other parts of
Virgil, with great success; as particularly your
lordship, whose version of Orpheus and Eurydice
is eminently good. Amongst the dead authors,
the Silenus of my Lord Roscommon cannot be too
much commended. I say nothing of Sir John Denham,
Mr Waller, and Mr Cowley;<a id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> it is the utmost
of my ambition to be thought their equal, or not to
be much inferior to them, and some others of the
living. But it is one thing to take pains on a fragment,
and translate it perfectly; and another thing
to have the weight of a whole author on my shoulders.
They who believe the burden light, let them
attempt the fourth, sixth, or eighth Pastoral; the
first or fourth Georgic; and, amongst the &AElig;ne&iuml;ds,
the fourth, the fifth, the seventh, the ninth, the
tenth, the eleventh, or the twelfth; for in these I
think I have succeeded best.</p>

<p>Long before I undertook this work, I was no
stranger to the original. I had also studied Virgil's
design, his disposition of it, his manners, his judicious
management of the figures, the sober retrenchments
of his sense, which always leave somewhat
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
to gratify our imagination, on which it may enlarge
at pleasure; but, above all, the elegance of his expressions,
and the harmony of his numbers: for, as
I have said in a former dissertation, the words are,
in poetry, what the colours are in painting; if the
design be good, and the draught be true, the colouring
is the first beauty that strikes the eye.<a id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Spenser
and Milton are the nearest, in English, to Virgil
and Horace in the Latin; and I have endeavoured
to form my style by imitating their masters.
I will further own to you, my lord, that my chief
ambition is to please those readers who have discernment
enough to prefer Virgil before any other
poet in the Latin tongue. Such spirits as he desired
to please, such would I chuse for my judges,
and would stand or fall by them alone. S&eacute;grais has
distinguished the readers of poetry, according to
their capacity of judging, into three classes; (he
might have said the same of writers too, if he had
pleased.) In the lowest form he places those whom
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
he calls <i>les petits esprits</i>&mdash;such things as are our
upper-gallery audience in a playhouse, who like nothing
but the husk and rind of wit; prefer a quibble,
a conceit, an epigram, before solid sense and
elegant expression; these are mob readers. If Virgil
and Martial stood for parliament-men, we know
already who would carry it. But, though they
make the greatest appearance in the field, and cry
the loudest, the best on't is, they are but a sort of
French Huguenots, or Dutch boors, brought over in
herds, but not naturalized; who have not land of
two pounds per annum in Parnassus, and therefore
are not privileged to poll. Their authors are of the
same level, fit to represent them on a mountebank's
stage, or to be masters of the ceremonies in
a bear-garden. Yet these are they who have the
most admirers. But it often happens, to their mortification,
that, as their readers improve their stock
of sense, (as they may by reading better books, and
by conversation with men of judgment,) they soon
forsake them: and when the torrent from the mountains
falls no more, the swelling writer is reduced
into his shallow bed, like the Mançanares at Madrid,
with scarce water to moisten his own pebbles.<a id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
There are a middle sort of readers, (as we
hold there is a middle state of souls,) such as have
a farther insight than the former, yet have not the
capacity of judging right; for I speak not of those
who are bribed by a party, and know better, if they
were not corrupted; but I mean a company of warm
young men, who are not yet arrived so far as to discern
the difference betwixt fustian, or ostentatious
sentences, and the true sublime. These are above
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
liking Martial, or Owen's Epigrams, but they would
certainly set Virgil below Statius or Lucan. I need
not say their poets are of the same taste with their
admirers. They affect greatness in all they write;
but it is a bladdered greatness, like that of the vain
man whom Seneca describes&mdash;an ill habit of body,
full of humours, and swelled with dropsy. Even
these too desert their authors, as their judgment
ripens. The young gentlemen themselves are commonly
misled by their pedagogue at school, their
tutor at the university, or their governor in their travels:
and many of those three sorts are the most
positive blockheads in the world. How many of
those flatulent writers have I known, who have
sunk in their reputation, after seven or eight editions
of their works! for indeed they are poets only
for young men. They had great success at their
first appearance; but, not being of God, (as a wit
said formerly,) they could not stand.</p>

<p>I have already named two sorts of judges; but
Virgil wrote for neither of them: and, by his example,
I am not ambitious of pleasing the lowest
or the middle form of readers.</p>

<p>He chose to please the most judicious&mdash;souls of
the highest rank, and truest understanding. These
are few in number; but whoever is so happy as to
gain their approbation, can never lose it, because
they never give it blindly. Then they have a certain
magnetism in their judgment, which attracts
others to their sense. Every day they gain some
new proselyte, and in time become the church. For
this reason, a well-weighed judicious poem, which
at its first appearance gains no more upon the world
than to be just received, and rather not blamed than
much applauded, insinuates itself by insensible degrees
into the liking of the reader: the more he
studies it, the more it grows upon him; every time
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
he takes it up, he discovers some new graces in
it. And whereas poems, which are produced by the
vigour of imagination only, have a gloss upon them
at the first, which time wears off; the works of
judgment are like the diamond; the more they are
polished, the more lustre they receive. Such is
the difference betwixt Virgil's &AElig;ne&iuml;s and Marini's
Adone. And, if I may be allowed to change the metaphor,
I would say, that Virgil is like the Fame
which he describes:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Mobilitate viget, viresque acquirit eundo</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Such a sort of reputation is my aim, though in a
far inferior degree, according to my motto in the
title-page&mdash;<i>Sequiturque patrem non passibus &aelig;quis</i>:
and therefore I appeal to the highest court of judicature,
like that of the peers, of which your lordship
is so great an ornament.</p>

<p>Without this ambition, which I own, of desiring
to please the <i>judices natos</i>, I could never have been
able to have done any thing at this age, when the
fire of poetry is commonly extinguished in other
men. Yet Virgil has given me the example of Entellus
for my encouragement: when he was well
heated, the younger champion could not stand before
him. And we find the elder contended not for
the gift, but for the honour&mdash;<i>nec dona moror</i>: for
Dampier has informed us, in his voyages, that the
air of the country which produces gold, is never
wholesome.</p>

<p>I had long since considered, that the way to
please the best judges is not to translate a poet literally,
and Virgil least of any other: for, his peculiar
beauty lying in his choice of words, I am excluded
from it by the narrow compass of our heroic
verse, unless I would make use of monosyllables
only, and those clogged with consonants, which are
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
the dead weight of our mother-tongue. It is possible,
I confess, though it rarely happens, that a
verse of monosyllables may sound harmoniously;
and some examples of it I have seen. My first line
of the &AElig;ne&iuml;s is not harsh&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Arms, and the man I sing, who, forced by fate, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But a much better instance may be given from the
last line of Manilius, made English by our learned
and judicious Mr Creech&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Nor could the world have borne so fierce a flame&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>where the many liquid consonants are placed so artfully,
that they give a pleasing sound to the words,
though they are all of one syllable.</p>

<p>It is true, I have been sometimes forced upon it
in other places of this work: but I never did it out
of choice; I was either in haste, or Virgil gave me
no occasion for the ornament of words; for it seldom
happens but a monosyllable line turns verse to
prose; and even that prose is rugged and unharmonious.
Philarchus, I remember, taxes Balzac for
placing twenty monosyllables in file, without one
dissyllable betwixt them. The way I have taken is
not so strait as metaphrase, nor so loose as paraphrase:
some things too I have omitted, and sometimes
have added of my own. Yet the omissions,
I hope, are but of circumstances, and such as would
have no grace in English; and the additions, I also
hope, are easily deduced from Virgil's sense. They
will seem, (at least I have the vanity to think so,)
not stuck into him, but growing out of him. He
studies brevity more than any other poet: but he
had the advantage of a language wherein much may
be comprehended in a little space. We, and all the
modern tongues, have more articles and pronouns,
besides signs of tenses and cases, and other barbarities
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
on which our speech is built by the faults of our
forefathers. The Romans founded theirs upon the
Greek: and the Greeks, we know, were labouring
many hundred years upon their language, before
they brought it to perfection. They rejected all
those signs, and cut off as many articles as they
could spare; comprehending in one word what we
are constrained to express in two, which is one
reason why we cannot write so concisely as they
have done. The word <i>pater</i>, for example, signifies
not only <i>a</i> father, but <i>your</i> father, <i>my</i> father, <i>his</i> or
<i>her</i> father, all included in a word.</p>

<p>This inconvenience is common to all modern
tongues; and this alone constrains us to employ
more words than the ancients needed. But, having
before observed, that Virgil endeavours to be short,
and at the same time elegant, I pursue the excellence,
and forsake the brevity: for there he is like
ambergris, a rich perfume, but of so close and glutinous
a body, that it must be opened with inferior
scents of musk or civet, or the sweetness will not
be drawn out into another language.</p>

<p>On the whole matter, I thought fit to steer betwixt
the two extremes of paraphrase and literal
translation; to keep as near my author as I could,
without losing all his graces, the most eminent of
which are in the beauty of his words; and those
words, I must add, are always figurative. Such of
these as would retain their elegance in our tongue,
I have endeavoured to graff on it; but most of
them are of necessity to be lost, because they will
not shine in any but their own. Virgil has sometimes
two of them in a line; but the scantiness of
our heroic verse is not capable of receiving more
than one; and that too must expiate for many
others which have none. Such is the difference of
the languages, or such my want of skill in chusing
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
words. Yet I may presume to say, and I hope
with as much reason as the French translator, that,
taking all the materials of this divine author, I have
endeavoured to make Virgil speak such English as
he would himself have spoken, if he had been born
in England, and in this present age. I acknowledge,
with S&eacute;grais, that I have not succeeded in
this attempt according to my desire: yet I shall
not be wholly without praise, if in some sort I may
be allowed to have copied the clearness, the purity,
the easiness, and the magnificence, of his style.
But I shall have occasion to speak farther on this
subject before I end the Preface.</p>

<p>When I mentioned the Pindaric line, I should
have added, that I take another licence in my
verses: for I frequently make use of triplet rhymes,
and for the same reason, because they bound the
sense. And therefore I generally join these two
licences together, and make the last verse of the triplet
a Pindaric:<a id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> for, besides the majesty which it
gives, it confines the sense within the barriers of
three lines, which would languish if it were lengthened
into four. Spenser is my example for both
these privileges of English verses; and Chapman
has followed him in his translation of Homer. Mr
Cowley has given into them after both; and all
succeeding writers after him. I regard them now
as the <i>Magna Charta</i> of heroic poetry, and am too
much an Englishman to lose what my ancestors
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
have gained for me. Let the French and Italians
value themselves on their regularity; strength and
elevation are our standard. I said before, and I repeat
it, that the affected purity of the French has
unsinewed their heroic verse. The language of an
epic poem is almost wholly figurative: yet they are
so fearful of a metaphor, that no example of Virgil
can encourage them to be bold with safety. Sure
they might warm themselves by that sprightly blaze,
without approaching it so close as to singe their
wings; they may come as near it as their master.
Not that I would discourage that purity of diction
in which he excels all other poets. But he knows
how far to extend his franchises, and advances to
the verge, without venturing a foot beyond it. On
the other side, without being injurious to the memory
of our English Pindar, I will presume to say,
that his metaphors are sometimes too violent, and
his language is not always pure. But, at the same
time, I must excuse him; for, through the iniquity
of the times, he was forced to travel, at an age when,
instead of learning foreign languages, he should
have studied the beauties of his mother-tongue,
which, like all other speeches, is to be cultivated
early, or we shall never write it with any kind of
elegance.<a id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> Thus, by gaining abroad, he lost at
home; like the painter in the "Arcadia," who, going
to see a skirmish, had his arms lopped off, and returned,
says Sir Philip Sidney, well instructed how
to draw a battle, but without a hand to perform his
work.</p>

<p>There is another thing in which I have presumed
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
to deviate from him and Spenser. They both make
hemisticks, (or half verses,) breaking off in the middle
of a line. I confess there are not many such
in the "Fairy Queen;" and even those few might
be occasioned by his unhappy choice of so long a
stanza. Mr Cowley had found out, that no kind
of staff is proper for a heroic poem, as being all too
lyrical: yet, though he wrote in couplets, where
rhyme is freer from constraint, he frequently affects
half verses; of which we find not one in Homer,
and I think not in any of the Greek poets, or the
Latin, excepting only Virgil; and there is no question
but he thought he had Virgil's authority for
that licence. But, I am confident, our poet never
meant to leave him, or any other, such a precedent:
and I ground my opinion on these two reasons:
first, we find no example of a hemistick in
any of his Pastorals or Georgics; for he had given
the last finishing strokes to both these poems: but
his &AElig;ne&iuml;s he left so incorrect, at least so short of
that perfection at which he aimed, that we know
how hard a sentence he passed upon it: and, in the
second place, I reasonably presume, that he intended
to have filled up all those hemisticks, because in
one of them we find the sense imperfect:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Quem tibi jam Troj&acirc;</i>&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>which some foolish grammarian has ended for him
with a half line of nonsense:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">----<i>peperit fumante Cr&euml;usa</i>:<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>for Ascanius must have been born some years before
the burning of that city; which I need not
prove. On the other side, we find also, that he
himself filled up one line in the Sixth &AElig;ne&iuml;d, the
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
enthusiasm seizing him, while he was reading to
Augustus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Misenum &AElig;olidem, quo non pr&aelig;stantior alter</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>&AElig;re ciere viros</i>&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>to which he added, in that transport, <i>Martemque
accendere cantu</i>: and never was any line more nobly
finished; for the reasons which I have given in
the Book of Painting. On these considerations I
have shunned hemisticks; not being willing to
imitate Virgil to a fault, like Alexander's courtiers,
who affected to hold their necks awry, because he
could not help it.<a id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> I am confident your lordship
is by this time of my opinion, and that you will
look on those half lines hereafter, as the imperfect
products of a hasty Muse: like the frogs and serpents
in the Nile; part of them kindled into life,
and part a lump of unformed unanimated mud.</p>

<p>I am sensible that many of my whole verses are
as imperfect as those halves, for want of time to digest
them better: but give me leave to make the
excuse of Boccace, who, when he was upbraided
that some of his novels had not the spirit of the
rest, returned this answer, that Charlemagne, who
made the paladins, was never able to raise an army
of them. The leaders may be heroes, but the multitude
must consist of common men.</p>

<p>I am also bound to tell your lordship, in my own
defence, that, from the beginning of the First Georgic
to the end of the last &AElig;ne&iuml;d, I found the difficulty
of translation growing on me in every succeeding
book: for Virgil, above all poets, had a
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
stock, which I may call almost inexhaustible, of figurative,
elegant, and sounding words. I, who inherit
but a small portion of his genius, and write
in a language so much inferior to the Latin, have
found it very painful to vary phrases, when the
same sense returns upon me. Even he himself,
whether out of necessity or choice, has often expressed
the same thing in the same words, and often
repeated two or three whole verses, which he
had used before. Words are not so easily coined
as money; and yet we see that the credit, not only
of banks, but of exchequers, cracks, when little
comes in, and much goes out. Virgil called upon
me in every line for some new word: and I paid so
long, that I was almost bankrupt; so that the latter
end must needs be more burdensome than the
beginning or the middle; and, consequently, the
twelfth &AElig;ne&iuml;d cost me double the time of the
first and second. What had become of me, if Virgil
had taxed me with another book? I had certainly
been reduced to pay the public in hammered
money, for want of milled; that is, in the same
old words which I had used before: and the receivers
must have been forced to have taken any
thing, where there was so little to be had.<a id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>Besides this difficulty (with which I have struggled,
and made a shift to pass it over,) there is one
remaining, which is insuperable to all translators.
We are bound to our author's sense, though with
the latitudes already mentioned; for I think it not
so sacred, as that one <i>iota</i> must not be added or diminished,
on pain of an <i>anathema</i>. But slaves we
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
are, and labour on another man's plantation; we
dress the vineyard, but the wine is the owner's: if
the soil be sometimes barren, then we are sure of
being scourged: if it be fruitful, and our care succeeds,
we are not thanked; for the proud reader
will only say, the poor drudge has done his duty.
But this is nothing to what follows; for, being
obliged to make his sense intelligible, we are forced
to untune our own verses, that we may give his
meaning to the reader. He, who invents, is master
of his thoughts and words: he can turn and vary
them as he pleases, till he renders them harmonious;
but the wretched translator has no such privilege:
for, being tied to the thoughts, he must
make what music he can in the expression; and,
for this reason, it cannot always be so sweet as
that of the original. There is a beauty of sound,
as S&eacute;grais has observed, in some Latin words, which
is wholly lost in any modern language. He instances
in that <i>mollis amaracus</i>, on which Venus lays Cupid,
in the First &AElig;ne&iuml;d. If I should translate it
<i>sweet-marjoram,</i> as the word signifies, the reader
would think I had mistaken Virgil: for those village-words,
as I may call them, give us a mean idea
of the thing; but the sound of the Latin is so much
more pleasing, by the just mixture of the vowels
with the consonants, that it raises our fancies to
conceive somewhat more noble than a common
herb, and to spread roses under him, and strew lilies
over him; a bed not unworthy the grandson of
the goddess.</p>

<p>If I cannot copy his harmonious numbers, how
shall I imitate his noble flights, where his thoughts
and words are equally sublime? <i>Quem</i></p>

my better sort of judges, when you take up my
version; and it will appear a passable beauty when
the original Muse is absent. But, like Spenser's
false Florimel made of snow, it melts and vanishes
when the true one comes in sight. I will not excuse,
but justify myself, for one pretended crime,
with which I am liable to be charged by false critics,
not only in this translation, but in many of
my original poems&mdash;that I latinize too much. It
is true, that, when I find an English word significant
and sounding, I neither borrow from the Latin,
nor any other language; but, when I want at
home, I must seek abroad.</p>

<p>If sounding words are not of our growth and
manufacture, who shall hinder me to import them
from a foreign country? I carry not out the treasure
of the nation, which is never to return; but
what I bring from Italy, I spend in England: here
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
it remains, and here it circulates; for, if the coin
be good, it will pass from one hand to another. I
trade both with the living and the dead, for the
enrichment of our native language. We have
enough in England to supply our necessity; but, if
we will have things of magnificence and splendour,
we must get them by commerce. Poetry requires
ornament; and that is not to be had from our old
Teuton monosyllables: therefore, if I find any elegant
word in a classic author, I propose it to be naturalized,
by using it myself; and, if the public
approves of it, the bill passes. But every man
cannot distinguish between pedantry and poetry:
every man, therefore, is not fit to innovate. Upon
the whole matter, a poet must first be certain that
the word he would introduce is beautiful in the Latin,
and is to consider, in the next place, whether
it will agree with the English idiom: after this, he
ought to take the opinion of judicious friends, such
as are learned in both languages: and, lastly, since
no man is infallible, let him use this licence very
sparingly; for, if too many foreign words are poured
in upon us, it looks as if they were designed not
to assist the natives, but to conquer them.</p>

<p>I am now drawing towards a conclusion, and suspect
your lordship is very glad of it. But permit
me first to own what helps I have had in this undertaking.
The late Earl of Lauderdale<a id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> sent me
over his new translation of the &AElig;ne&iuml;s, which he
had ended before I engaged in the same design.
Neither did I then intend it: but, some proposals
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
being afterwards made me by my bookseller, I desired
his lordship's leave that I might accept them,
which he freely granted; and I have his letter yet
to show for that permission. He resolved to have
printed his work, (which he might have done two
years before I could publish mine,) and had performed
it if death had not prevented him. But,
having his manuscript in my hands, I consulted it
as often as I doubted of my author's sense; for no
man understood Virgil better than that learned nobleman.
His friends, I hear, have yet another and
more correct copy of that translation by them,
which, had they pleased to have given the public,
the judges must have been convinced that I have
not flattered him. Besides this help, which was
not inconsiderable, Mr Congreve has done me the
favour to review the &AElig;ne&iuml;s, and compare my version
with the original. I shall never be ashamed
to own, that this excellent young man has shewed
me many faults, which I have endeavoured to correct.
It is true, he might have easily found more,
and then my translation had been more perfect.</p>

<p>Two other worthy friends of mine, who desire to
have their names concealed, seeing me straitened
in my time, took pity on me, and gave me the
"Life of Virgil," the two prefaces to the "Pastorals"
and the "Georgics," and all the arguments in
prose to the whole translation; which, perhaps,
has caused a report, that the two first poems are
not mine.<a id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> If it had been true, that I had taken
their verses for my own, I might have gloried in
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
their aid, and, like Terence, have fathered the opinion
that Scipio and L&aelig;lius joined with me. But
the same style being continued through the whole,
and the same laws of versification observed, are
proofs sufficient, that this is one man's work:
and your lordship is too well acquainted with my
manner, to doubt that any part of it is another's.</p>

<p>That your lordship may see I was in earnest
when I promised to hasten to an end, I will not
give the reasons why I writ not always in the proper
terms of navigation, land-service, or in the cant
of any profession. I will only say, that Virgil has
avoided those proprieties, because he writ not to
mariners, soldiers, astronomers, gardeners, peasants,
&amp;c. but to all in general, and in particular to men
and ladies of the first quality, who have been better
bred than to be too nicely knowing in the
terms. In such cases, it is enough for a poet to
write so plainly, that he may be understood by his
readers; to avoid impropriety, and not affect to be
thought learned in all things.</p>

<p>I have omitted the four preliminary lines of the
First &AElig;ne&iuml;d, because I think them inferior to any
four others in the whole poem, and consequently
believe they are not Virgil's.<a id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> There is too great
a gap betwixt the adjective <i>vicina</i> in the second
line, and the substantive <i>arva</i> in the latter end of
the third, which keeps his meaning in obscurity
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
too long, and is contrary to the clearness of his
style.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Ut quamvis avido</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is too ambitious an ornament to be his; and</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Gratum opus agricolis</i>,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>are all words unnecessary, and independent of what
he had said before.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<i>Horrentia Martis</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Arma</i>&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is worse than any of the rest. <i>Horrentia</i> is such a
flat epithet, as Tully would have given us in his
verses. It is a mere filler, to stop a vacancy in the
hexameter, and connect the preface to the work of
Virgil. Our author seems to sound a charge, and
begins like the clangor of a trumpet:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Arma, virumque cano, Troj&aelig; qui primus ab oris</i> ...<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>scarce a word without an <i>r</i>, and the vowels, for the
greater part, sonorous. The prefacer began with
<i>Ille ego</i>, which he was constrained to patch up in
the fourth line with <i>at nunc</i>, to make the sense cohere;
and, if both those words are not notorious
botches, I am much deceived, though the French
translator thinks otherwise. For my own part, I
am rather of the opinion, that they were added by
Tucca and Varius, than retrenched.</p>

<p>I know it may be answered, by such as think
Virgil the author of the four lines, that he asserts
his title to the &AElig;ne&iuml;s in the beginning of this work,
as he did to the two former in the last lines of the
Fourth Georgic. I will not reply otherwise to this,
than by desiring them to compare these four lines
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
with the four others, which we know are his, because
no poet but he alone could write them. If
they cannot distinguish creeping from flying, let
them lay down Virgil, and take up Ovid, <i>de Ponto</i>,
in his stead. My master needed not the assistance
of that preliminary poet to prove his claim. His
own majestic mien discovers him to be the king,
amidst a thousand courtiers. It was a superfluous
office; and, therefore, I would not set those verses
in the front of Virgil, but have rejected them<a id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> to
my own preface.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I, who before, with shepherds in the groves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sung, to my oaten pipe, their rural loves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, issuing thence, compelled the neighbouring field<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A plenteous crop of rising corn to yield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Manured the glebe, and stocked the fruitful plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(A poem grateful to the greedy swain,) &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>If there be not a tolerable line in all these six,
the prefacer gave me no occasion to write better.
This is a just apology in this place; but I have
done great wrong to Virgil in the whole translation:
want of time, the inferiority of our language,
the inconvenience of rhyme, and all the other excuses
I have made, may alleviate my fault, but cannot
justify the boldness of my undertaking. What
avails it me to acknowledge freely, that I have
not been able to do him right in any line? for even
my own confession makes against me; and it will
always be returned upon me, "Why then did you
attempt it?" To which no other answer can be
made, than that I have done him less injury than
any of his former libellers.</p>

<p>What they called his picture, had been drawn at
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
length, so many times, by the daubers of almost all
nations, and still so unlike him, that I snatched up
the pencil with disdain; being satisfied before-hand,
that I could make some small resemblance of him,
though I must be content with a worse likeness. A
Sixth Pastoral, a Pharmaceutria, a single Orpheus,
and some other features, have been exactly taken:
but those holiday-authors writ for pleasure; and
only showed us what they could have done, if they
would have taken pains to perform the whole.</p>

<p>Be pleased, my lord, to accept, with your wonted
goodness, this unworthy present which I make
you. I have taken off one trouble from you, of defending
it, by acknowledging its imperfections:
and, though some part of them are covered in the
verse, (as Erichthonius rode always in a chariot, to
hide his lameness,) such of them as cannot be concealed,
you will please to connive at, though, in the
strictness of your judgment, you cannot pardon.
If Homer was allowed to nod sometimes in so long
a work, it will be no wonder if I often fall asleep.
You took my "Aureng-Zebe"<a id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> into your protection,
with all his faults: and I hope here cannot be so
many, because I translate an author who gives me
such examples of correctness. What my jury may
be, I know not; but it is good for a criminal to
plead before a favourable judge: if I had said partial,
would your lordship have forgiven me? or will
you give me leave to acquaint the world, that I have
many times been obliged to your bounty since the
Revolution? Though I never was reduced to beg a
charity, nor ever had the impudence to ask one,
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
either of your lordship, or your noble kinsman the
Earl of Dorset,<a id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> much less of any other; yet, when
I least expected it, you have both remembered me:
so inherent it is in your family not to forget an old
servant. It looks rather like ingratitude on my part,
that, where I have been so often obliged, I have appeared
so seldom to return my thanks, and where
I was also so sure of being well received. Somewhat
of laziness was in the case, and somewhat too
of modesty, but nothing of disrespect or of unthankfulness.
I will not say that your lordship has encouraged
me to this presumption, lest, if my labours
meet with no success in public, I may expose your
judgment to be censured. As for my own enemies,
I shall never think them worth an answer; and, if
your lordship has any, they will not dare to arraign
you for want of knowledge in this art, till they can
produce somewhat better of their own, than your
"Essay on Poetry." It was on this consideration,
that I have drawn out my preface to so great a
length. Had I not addressed to a poet and a critic
of the first magnitude, I had myself been taxed
for want of judgment, and shamed my patron for
want of understanding. But neither will you, my
lord, so soon be tired as any other, because the discourse
is on your art; neither will the learned reader
think it tedious, because it is<a id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a><i>ad Clerum</i>. At least,
when he begins to be weary, the church-doors are
open. That I may pursue the allegory with a short
prayer after a long sermon&mdash;</p>

more earnestly by any man, than by</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_28_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28_28"><span class="label">[28]</span></a> Mulgrave's early and intimate connection with our author
has been often noticed in the course of this edition. In the reign
of William III. he remained in a sort of disgrace, from his attachment
to the exiled king: yet, in 1694, he was created Marquis
of Normanby: in the reign of the queen, he rose still higher;
and it is said, that the dignities, offices, and influence, which he
then enjoyed, were the reward of the ambitious love which he
had dared to entertain for that princess, when she was only the
Lady Anne, second daughter to the Duke of York.&mdash;See <i>Dryden's
Life</i>; also <i>Dedication to Aureng-Zebe</i>, Vol. V. p. 174.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_29_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29_29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> The early editions, by an absurd and continued blunder, read
Aristotle. Ariosto, and indeed all the heroic Italian poets, Tasso
excepted, have chequered their romantic fictions with lighter stories,
such as those of Jocondo and of Adonio, in the "Orlando
Furioso." But neither Ariosto, nor his predecessors Boiardo and
Pulci, ever entertained the idea of writing a regular epic poem
after the ancient rules. On the contrary, they often drop the mask
in the middle of the romantic wonders which they relate; and
plainly shew, how very far they are from considering the narrative
as serious. It was, therefore, consistent with their plan, to
admit such light and frivolous narratives, as might relieve the general
gravity of their tale, which resembled an epic poem as
little as a melo-drama does a tragedy.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_30_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30_30"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> I quote, from Mr Malone, Mr Harte's vindication of Statius;
premising, however, that it is far from amounting to an exculpation
of that boisterous author, whose works have fallen into oblivion
even among scholars, in due proportion to the ripening of
poetical taste.
</p>
<p>
"Mr Dryden, in his excellent Preface to the &AElig;neid, takes occasion
to quarrel with Statius, and calls the present book (the
Sixth) 'an ill-timed and injudicious episode.' I wonder so severe
a remark could pass from that gentleman, who was an admirer
of our author, even to superstition. I own I can scarce forgive
myself to contradict so great a poet, and so good a critic:
<i>talium enim virorum ut admiratio maxima, ita censura difficilis</i>.
However, the present case may admit of very alleviating circumstances.
It may be replied, in general, that the design of this
book was to give a respite to the main action, introducing a
mournful, but pleasing variation, from terror to pity. It is also
highly probable, that Statius had an eye to the funeral obsequies
of Polydore and Anchises, mentioned in the third and fifth books
of Virgil. We may also look upon them as a prelude, opening
the mind by degrees to receive the miseries and horror of a future
war. This is intimated in some measure by the derivation
of the word <i>Archemorus</i>."&mdash;<i>Note on Mr Walter Harte's Translation
of the Sixth Book of the Thebaid.</i>
</p>
<p>
Notwithstanding what Mr Harte has stated, our author seldom
mentions Statius, without reprobating his turgid and bombast stile.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_31_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31_31"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> Dryden, as was excellently observed by Sir Samuel Garth, in
his "Funeral Eulogy," always thought that species of composition
most excellent upon which his labour had been more immediately
employed. In the "Essay upon Dramatic Poesy," he had
preferred the tragedy to the epic poem, and here he has reversed
their station and rank. I think the principal distinction is
noticed below. Tragedy is addressed, as it were, to the eye; and
the whole scene to be enjoyed, even in perusal, must be supposed
present to the observation. But epic poetry is, by its nature,
narrative; and, therefore, while it is capable of the beauties of
more extended description, and more copious morality, it is excluded
from that immediate and energetic appeal to the senses
manifested in the drama.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_32_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32_32"><span class="label">[32]</span></a> The cant of supposing, that the Iliad contained an obvious
and intentional moral, was at this time so established among
the critics, that even Dryden durst not shake himself free of
it. In all probability, the ancient blind bard only thought of
so arranging his splendid tale of Troy divine, that it should arrest
the attention of his hearers. Doubtless, an admirable moral
may be often extracted from his poem; because it contains
an accurate picture of human nature, which can never be truly
presented, without conveying a lesson of instruction. But it may
shrewdly be suspected, that the moral was as little intended by
the author, as it would have been the object of a historian, whose
work is equally pregnant with morality, though a detail of facts
be only intended. We may be pretty sure, that Homer meant
his Achilles, the favourite of the gods, as a character approaching
perfection; and if he is cruel, proud, disobedient, and vengeful,
I am afraid it was only because these attributes, in a savage
state, are deemed as little derogatory from the character of a hero,
as dissipation and gallantry are blemishes in that of a modern
fine gentleman.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_33_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33_33"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> The opinion of Horace is a confirmation of what is stated
above. None of the ancients ventured to impute the rudeness of
Homer's characters to the barbarity of the poet's age. The faults
which they could not shut their eyes against, must, they thought,
have been equally apparent to the bard himself; although, in all
probability, he meant, that these very attributes in his heroes
should be considered as virtues.</p></div>

much sound criticism, expressed in pointed language; although the

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_38_38"></a><a href="#FNanchor_38_38"><span class="label">[38]</span></a> Our author mentions elsewhere, "The Essay of Poetry, which I
publicly valued before I knew the author of it." Vol. XII. p.
275. Although his lordship's experiment proved thus successful,
I may be permitted to hint, that most noble authors may find it
rather hazardous.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_39_39"></a><a href="#FNanchor_39_39"><span class="label">[39]</span></a> Tasso's "Jerusalem Delivered," seems to have been the first
heroic poem attempted upon a classical model, after the revival of
literature.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_40_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_40_40"><span class="label">[40]</span></a> Pulci wrote the "Movagante Maggiore," Boiardo the "Orlando
Innamorato," and Ariosto the well-known continuation of
that poem, called the "Orlando Furioso." The first two poems,
like the "Amadigi," and a number of others in the same taste, are
rather to be considered as an improvement upon the old metrical
romances, than as attempts at epic poetry. At the same time,
these authors do not always expect their readers to receive with
gravity, the marvels which they narrate; but introduce at every
turn some ludicrous image, to shew how little they are themselves
serious. Although Ariosto is immeasurably distinguished by brilliancy
of imagination, and beauty of expression, from the rest of
those romancers, yet even his delightful work may be more properly
termed a romance of chivalry than an epic poem; a distinction
which the Tuscan bard can hardly regret, since it has afforded,
throughout Europe, more general delight than all the epics in the
world, if we except those of Homer and Virgil.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_41_41"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41_41"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> "La Pucelle D'Orleans." It will hardly, I hope, be expected,
that an editor of Dryden should be deeply read in the French
epopee, which of all styles of poetry is the most uniformly stiff and
freezing.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_42_42"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42_42"><span class="label">[42]</span></a> That Spenser's twelve champions, each of whom was to atchieve
a distinct and separate adventure, could ever have been
so brought together, as to entitle the "Fairy Queen" to be called
a regular epic, may be justly doubted, I confess I think it probable,
that the difficulty of concluding his work, was one great cause
of its being left unfinished.</p>
<p>Dryden's objection to the "Paradise Lost," is founded on the unhappy
termination, which is contrary to the rules of the epopee.
Even so it has been disputed, whether a tragedy, which ends happily,
is properly and regularly entitled to the name. Yet the
story is more completely winded up in the "Paradise Lost," than
in the "Iliad," where Troy is left standing, after all the battles which
are fought about it. Our reverence for the ancients, in this and
many other instances, has been driven to superstitious bigotry.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_43_43"></a><a href="#FNanchor_43_43"><span class="label">[43]</span></a> In the following comparison, our author assumes, that the
"Iliad" was actually written with a view to its moral tendency.
But considering the matter fairly, and without prejudice, there is
as much reason for supposing, that Shakespeare had a great public
purpose to accomplish in every one of his plays; which we
know were only written to fill the Bull or the Fortune theatres, as
the songs of Homer were recited, minstrel-like, for the supply of
his daily wants. But both these gifted men had an intuitive
knowledge of human nature, which cannot be justly described,
without an evident, though undesigned, moral pressing itself on the
hearers. Virgil's poem, however, had certainly a political, if not
a moral purpose; for, while it gratified the nobles of the court of
Augustus, by deducing their descent from the followers of &AElig;neas,
it tamed their republican spirit, by describing the monarchy of the
emperor, not as an usurpation, but a hereditary, though interrupted
succession, from the wandering Prince of Troy.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_44_44"></a><a href="#FNanchor_44_44"><span class="label">[44]</span></a> This is one of our author's unseemly and far too frequent
sneers at the clerical order, for which he is severely reprehended
by Milbourne.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_45_45"></a><a href="#FNanchor_45_45"><span class="label">[45]</span></a> Here again Milbourne is very clamorous for authority, and exclaims,
that it is one of the fundamental laws of Parnassus to write
true history. Dryden probably rested upon the scandalous tale,
that C&aelig;sar intrigued with Servilia, the mother of Brutus; though
it seems more likely, that he applied to his assassin the endearing
epithet of <i>my son</i>, merely as a term of affectionate friendship.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_46_46"></a><a href="#FNanchor_46_46"><span class="label">[46]</span></a> The sense which our author has put on this line, has been
warmly disputed; many commentators contending, that the elder
Cato, called the Censor, and not Cato of Utica, is the person
therein honoured. Pope held the same opinion with our poet, and
abandoned it; and Spence, quoted by Mr Malone, thus expresses
himself:&mdash;"Virgil represents the blessed in Elysium, and Cato
giving laws to them. This agrees best with the character of Cato
the Censor. See Plutarch's account of the Elder Cato; of his
strict judgments and laws; of the statue set up to his honour in
the temple of Salus, and of the inscription under it, in his Life of
that great lawgiver. Seneca speaks as highly of him in that capacity,
as of Scipio in the military way: <i>M. Porcius Censorius,
quem tam rei public&aelig; profuit nasci, quam Scipionem; alter enim
cum hostibus nostris bellum, alter cum moribus gessit</i>. Epist.
lxxxvii. If Cato Uticensis could have been placed at all in Elysium
by Virgil, (who says, that such as kill themselves are in another
part of Hades,) he would, at least, be a very improper person
to be set by him in so eminent a situation there."</p></div>

&AElig;neidem sibi persuasum habebat; neque aliud quicquam poetam

accipiat; nulla regni seu imperii, monarchiam vocamus, bona videas
exposita aut commendata; verbo nihil occurrit, quo libertatis

jam monitum est locis pluribus; sed, quantam vim ea res
ad dominationem Augusti commendandam habere potuerit, mihi
non satis constare lubenter fateor. Neque, si nova &AElig;ne&aelig; sedes
in Latio divinis humanisque juribus vallata fuerit, quale inde propugnaculum
novo Augusti regno partum sit, intelligo; ut adeo, si
demonstrari hoc possit, poet&aelig; consilium illud in &AElig;neide condenda
propositum fuisse, parum feliciter eum in eo perficiendo et exsequendo
versatum videri dicerem.

"In eandem tamen opinionem jam ante Spencium inciderat vir
doctus inter Francogallos, [L'Abb&eacute; Vatry,] qui imprimis similitudinem

persequitur. Ingeniose eum ludere non neges; et convenit ei cum
multis aliis doctis viris, qui opinantur, Augustum sub &AElig;ne&aelig; persona

<p>I think the passage may easily be interpreted without disparagement
of &AElig;neas's valour, even without adopting Dryden's construction.
Turnus, a brave and proud man, reduced to the humiliating
situation of confessing his fears, naturally imputes them
to the more honourable cause, a dread, namely, of supernatural
interference. To confess his terror to arise from the force of his
mortal adversary, would have been degrading to his character.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_72_72"></a><a href="#FNanchor_72_72"><span class="label">[72]</span></a> It is singular, that, under this conviction, Dryden should have
complied with the custom of his age, in striking out the vowel before
the end of such words as <i>winged</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_73_73"></a><a href="#FNanchor_73_73"><span class="label">[73]</span></a> This celebrated couplet occurs in Sir John Denham's "Cooper's
Hill," a poem which was praised beyond its merit by the
author's contemporaries. After allowing that the lines are smooth
and sonorous, which indeed were infrequent qualities of the versification
of the period, I fear much of their merit lies in the skilful
antithesis of the attributes of the river.</p></div>

one possessing those true poetic qualities, which consist in the
thought and not in the mere arrangement of expression, will shine
most in the easiest structure of versification. But there is a very
inferior, yet not altogether contemptible kind of poet, whose merit
consists more in melody of versification, and neatness or even felicity
of expression, than in his powers of conception. Such bards
will do well to avail themselves of the melody of rhyme.</p></div>

Fresnoy's "Art of Painting."</p>
<p>"I am now come, though with the omission of many likenesses,
to the third part of Painting, which is called cromatic, or colouring.
Expression, and all that belongs to words, is that in a poem
which colouring is in a picture. The colours well chosen in their
proper places, together with the lights and shadows which belong
to them, lighten the design, and make it pleasing to the eye. The
words, the expressions, the tropes and figures, the versification,
and all the other elegancies of sound, as cadences, turns of words
upon the thought, and many other things which are all parts of
expression, perform exactly the same office, both in dramatic and
epic poetry. Our author calls colouring&mdash;<i>lena sororis</i>; in plain
English, the bawd of her sister, the design or drawing: she clothes,
she dresses her up, she paints her, she makes her appear more
lovely than naturally she is, she procures for the design, and makes
lovers for her; for the design of itself is only so many naked lines.
Thus in poetry, the expression is that which charms the reader,
and beautifies the design, which is only the outlines of the fables."</p></div>

<p class="center font09 pmb1">ARGUMENT.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="ii1 pmb2"><i>The Trojans, after a seven years' voyage, set sail for Italy, but are
overtaken by a dreadful storm, which &AElig;olus raises at Juno's request.
The tempest sinks one, and scatters the rest. Neptune
drives off the Winds, and calms the sea. &AElig;neas, with his own
ship, and six more, arrives safe at an African port. Venus complains
to Jupiter of her son's misfortunes. Jupiter comforts her,
and sends Mercury to procure him a kind reception among the
Carthaginians. &AElig;neas, going out to discover the country, meets
his mother, in the shape of a huntress, who conveys him in a cloud
to Carthage, where he sees his friends whom he thought lost, and
receives a kind entertainment from the queen. Dido, by a device
of Venus, begins to have a passion for him, and, after some discourse
with him, desires the history of his adventures since the
siege of Troy, which is the subject of the two following Books.</i></p>

<span class="i0">What goddess was provoked, and whence her hate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For what offence the queen of heaven began<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To persecute so brave, so just a man;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Involved his anxious life in endless cares,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exposed to wants, and hurried into wars!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can heavenly minds such high resentment show,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or exercise their spite in human woe?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Against the Tyber's mouth, but far away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An ancient town was seated on the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Tyrian colony; the people made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stout for the war, and studious of their trade:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Carthage the name; beloved by Juno more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than her own Argos, or the Samian shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here stood her chariot; here, if heaven were kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The seat of awful empire she designed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet she had heard an ancient rumour fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Long cited by the people of the sky,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That times to come should see the Trojan race<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her Carthage ruin, and her towers deface;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor thus confined, the yoke of sovereign sway<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should on the necks of all the nations lay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She pondered this, and feared it was in fate; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor could forget the war she waged of late, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For conquering Greece against the Trojan state. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besides, long causes working in her mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And secret seeds of envy, lay behind:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep graven in her heart, the doom remained<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of partial Paris, and her form disdained;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The grace bestowed on ravished Ganymed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Electra's glories, and her injured bed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each was a cause alone; and all combined<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To kindle vengeance in her haughty mind.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
<span class="i0">For this, far distant from the Latian coast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She drove the remnants of the Trojan host:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seven long years the unhappy wandering train<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were tossed by storms, and scattered through the main.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such time, such toil, required the Roman name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such length of labour for so vast a frame.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now scarce the Trojan fleet, with sails and oars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had left behind the fair Sicilian shores,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Entering with cheerful shouts the watery reign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ploughing frothy furrows in the main;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, labouring still with endless discontent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The queen of heaven did thus her fury vent:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Then am I vanquished? must I yield?" said she:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And must the Trojans reign in Italy?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Fate will have it; and Jove adds his force;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor can my power divert their happy course.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could angry Pallas, with revengeful spleen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Grecian navy burn, and drown the men?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She, for the fault of one offending foe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bolts of Jove himself presumed to throw:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With whirlwinds from beneath she tossed the ship,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bare exposed the bosom of the deep:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, as an eagle gripes the trembling game,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wretch, yet hissing with her father's flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She strongly seized, and with a burning wound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Transfixed, and, naked, on a rock she bound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I, who walk in awful state above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The majesty of heaven, the sister wife of Jove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For length of years my fruitless force employ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the thin remains of ruined Troy!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What nations now to Juno's power will pray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or offerings on my slighted altars lay?"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus raged the goddess; and, with fury fraught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The restless regions of the storms she sought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where, in a spacious cave of living stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tyrant &AElig;olus, from his airy throne,<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With power imperial curbs the struggling winds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sounding tempests in dark prisons binds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This way, and that, the impatient captives tend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, pressing for release, the mountains rend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High in his hall the undaunted monarch stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shakes his sceptre, and their rage commands;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which did he not, their unresisted sway<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would sweep the world before them in their way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth, air, and seas, through empty space would roll,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heaven would fly before the driving soul.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In fear of this, the Father of the Gods <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confined their fury to those dark abodes, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And locked them safe within, oppressed with mountain loads; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Imposed a king, with arbitrary sway,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To loose their fetters, or their force allay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To whom the suppliant queen her prayers addressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus the tenor of her suit expressed:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O &AElig;olus! for to thee the king of heaven<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The power of tempests and of winds has given;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy force alone their fury can restrain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smooth the waves, or swell the troubled main&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Succeed my wish, and second my design, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">These airy kingdoms, and this wide command,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">He said, and hurled against the mountain side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His quivering spear, and all the god applied.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The raging winds rush through the hollow wound,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">South, East, and West, with mixed confusion roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And roll the foaming billows to the shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cables crack; the sailors' fearful cries  }<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ascend; and sable night involves the skies;   }<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heaven itself is ravished from their eyes.}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loud peals of thunder from the poles ensue;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then flashing fires the transient light renew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The face of things a frightful image bears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And present death in various forms appears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Struck with unusual fright, the Trojan chief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With lifted hands and eyes, invokes relief;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And "Thrice and four times happy those," he cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"That under Ilian walls, before their parents, died!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tydides, bravest of the Grecian train! <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why could not I by that strong arm be slain, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lie by noble Hector on the plain, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or great Sarpedon, in those bloody fields,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Simo&iuml;s rolls the bodies and the shields<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of heroes, whose dismembered hands yet bear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dart aloft, and clench the pointed spear!"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus while the pious prince his fate bewails,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fierce Boreas drove against his flying sails,<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And rent the sheets: the raging billows rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mount the tossing vessel to the skies:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor can the shivering oars sustain the blow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The galley gives her side, and turns her prow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While those astern, descending down the steep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through gaping waves behold the boiling deep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three ships were hurried by the Southern blast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the secret shelves with fury cast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those hidden rocks the Ausonian sailors knew:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They called them Altars, when they rose in view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And showed their spacious backs above the flood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three more fierce Eurus, in his angry mood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dashed on the shallows of the moving sand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in mid ocean left them moored a-land.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Orontes' bark, that bore the Lycian crew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(A horrid sight!) even in the hero's view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From stem to stern by waves was overborne:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The trembling pilot, from his rudder torn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was headlong hurled: thrice round the ship was tossed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then bulged at once, and in the deep was lost;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here and there above the waves were seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arms, pictures, precious goods, and floating men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stoutest vessel to the storm gave way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sucked, through loosened planks, the rushing sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ilioneus was her chief: Aletes old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Achates faithful, Abas young and bold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Endured not less: their ships, with gaping seams,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Admit the deluge of the briny streams.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Mean time imperial Neptune heard the sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of raging billows breaking on the ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Displeased, and fearing for his watery reign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He reared his awful head above the main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Serene in majesty; then rolled his eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around the space of earth, and seas, and skies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw the Trojan fleet dispersed, distressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By stormy winds and wintery heaven oppressed.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Full well the god his sister's envy knew,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He summoned Eurus and the Western blast,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then thus rebuked&mdash;"Audacious winds! from whence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This bold attempt, this rebel insolence?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is it for you to ravage seas and land,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His power to hollow caverns is confined:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There let him reign, the jailor of the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With hoarse commands his breathing subjects call,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The god himself with ready trident stands, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And opes the deep, and spreads the moving sands; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then heaves them off the shoals.&mdash;Where'er he guides <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His finny coursers, and in triumph rides, <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The waves unruffle, and the sea subsides. <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">As, when in tumults rise the ignoble crowd,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The quarry share, their plenteous dinner haste.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some strip the skin; some portion out the spoil; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The limbs, yet trembling, in the cauldrons boil; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some on the fire the reeking entrails broil. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stretched on the grassy turf, at ease they dine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Restore their strength with meat, and cheer their souls with wine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their hunger thus appeased, their care attends<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The doubtful fortune of their absent friends:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alternate hopes and fears their minds possess,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether to deem them dead, or in distress.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the rest, &AElig;neas mourns the fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of brave Orontes, and the uncertain state<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Gyas, Lycus, and of Amycus.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The day, but not their sorrows, ended thus;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, from aloft, almighty Jove surveys<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth, air, and shores, and navigable seas:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length on Libyan realms he fixed his eyes&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom, pondering thus on human miseries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Venus saw, she with a lowly look,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not free from tears, her heavenly sire bespoke:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O king of gods and men! whose awful hand <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disperses thunder on the seas and land; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disposes all with absolute command; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">How could my pious son thy power incense?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or what, alas! is vanished Troy's offence?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our hope of Italy not only lost, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">On various seas by various tempests tossed, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But shut from every shore, and barred from every coast. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">You promised once, a progeny divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Romans, rising from the Trojan line,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In after-times should hold the world in awe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the land and ocean give the law.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
<span class="i0">How is your doom reversed, which eased my care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Troy was ruined in that cruel war?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then fates to fates I could oppose: but now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Fortune still pursues her former blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What can I hope? What worse can still succeed?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What end of labours has your will decreed?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Antenor, from the midst of Grecian hosts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could pass secure, and pierce the Illyrian coasts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where, rolling down the steep, Timavus raves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And through nine channels disembogues his waves.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length he founded Padua's happy seat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gave his Trojans a secure retreat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There fixed their arms, and there renewed their name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there in quiet rules, and crowned with fame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But we, descended from your sacred line,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Entitled to your heaven and rites divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are banished earth, and, for the wrath of one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Removed from Latium, and the promised throne.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are these our sceptres? these our due rewards?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And is it thus that Jove his plighted faith regards?"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To whom the Father of the immortal race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smiling with that serene indulgent face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With which he drives the clouds and clears the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First gave a holy kiss; then thus replies:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Daughter, dismiss thy fears: to thy desire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fates of thine are fixed, and stand entire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt behold thy wished Lavinian walls;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, ripe for heaven, when fate &AElig;neas calls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then shalt thou bear him up, sublime, to me:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No councils have reversed my firm decree.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, lest new fears disturb thy happy state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Know, I have searched the mystic rolls of Fate:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy son (nor is the appointed season far)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Italy shall wage successful war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall tame fierce nations in the bloody field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sovereign laws impose, and cities build,<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Till, after every foe subdued, the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrice through the signs his annual race shall run:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is his time prefixed. Ascanius then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now called I&uuml;lus, shall begin his reign.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He thirty rolling years the crown shall wear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then from Lavinium shall the seat transfer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, with hard labour, Alba-longa build.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The throne with his succession shall be filled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three hundred circuits more: then shall be seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ilia the fair, a priestess and a queen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, full of Mars, in time, with kindly throes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall at a birth two goodly boys disclose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The royal babes a tawny wolf shall drain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Romulus his grandsire's throne shall gain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of martial towers the founder shall become,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The people Romans call, the city Rome.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To them no bounds of empire I assign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor term of years to their immortal line.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even haughty Juno, who, with endless broils,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth, seas, and heaven, and Jove himself, turmoils,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length atoned, her friendly power shall join,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To cherish and advance the Trojan line.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The subject world shall Rome's dominion own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, prostrate, shall adore the nation of the gown.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An age is ripening in revolving fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Troy shall overturn the Grecian state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sweet revenge her conquering sons shall call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To crush the people that conspired her fall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then C&aelig;sar from the Julian stock shall rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose empire ocean, and whose fame the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone shall bound; whom, fraught with eastern spoils,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our heaven, the just reward of human toils,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Securely shall repay with rites divine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And incense shall ascend before his sacred shrine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then dire debate, and impious war, shall cease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the stern age be softened into peace:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then banished Faith shall once again return,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Vestal fires in hallowed temples burn;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And Remus with Quirinus shall sustain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The righteous laws, and fraud and force restrain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Janus himself before his fane shall wait,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And keep the dreadful issues of his gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With bolts and iron bars: within remains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Imprisoned Fury, bound in brazen chains:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High on a trophy raised, of useless arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sits, and threats the world with vain alarms."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He said, and sent Cyllenius with command<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To free the ports, and ope the Punic land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Trojan guests; lest, ignorant of fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The queen might force them from her town and state.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down from the steep of heaven Cyllenius flies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cleaves with all his wings the yielding skies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon on the Libyan shore descends the god,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Performs his message, and displays his rod.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The surly murmurs of the people cease;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as the Fates required, they give the peace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The queen herself suspends the rigid laws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Trojans pities, and protects their cause.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Mean time, in shades of night &AElig;neas lies:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Care seized his soul, and sleep forsook his eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, when the sun restored the cheerful day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He rose, the coast and country to survey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anxious and eager to discover more.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It looked a wild uncultivated shore:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, whether human kind, or beasts alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Possessed the new-found region, was unknown.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath a ledge of rocks his fleet he hides: <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tall trees surround the mountain's shady sides: <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bending brow above a safe retreat provides. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Armed with two pointed darts, he leaves his friends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And true Achates on his steps attends.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo! in the deep recesses of the wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before his eyes his goddess mother stood&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A huntress in her habit and her mien:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her dress a maid, her air confessed a queen.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Bare were her knees, and knots her garments bind; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loose was her hair, and wantoned in the wind; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her hand sustained a bow; her quiver hung behind. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">She seemed a virgin of the Spartan blood: <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With such array Harpalyce bestrode <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her Thracian courser, and out-stripped the rapid flood. <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Ho! strangers! have you lately seen," she said, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"One of my sisters, like myself arrayed, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who crossed the lawn, or in the forest strayed? <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A painted quiver at her back she bore; <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Varied with spots, a lynx's hide she wore; <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at full cry pursued the tusky boar." <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus Venus: thus her son replied again:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"None of your sisters have we heard or seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O virgin! or what other name you bear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above that style:&mdash;O more than mortal fair!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your voice and mien celestial birth betray!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If, as you seem, the sister of the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or one at least of chaste Diana's train,<a id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let not an humble suppliant sue in vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But tell a stranger, long in tempests tossed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What earth we tread, and who commands the coast?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then on your name shall wretched mortals call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And offered victims at your altars fall."&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I dare not," she replied, "assume the name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of goddess, or celestial honours claim:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Tyrian virgins bows and quivers bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And purple buskins o'er their ankles wear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Know, gentle youth, in Libyan lands you are&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A people rude in peace, and rough in war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rising city, which from far you see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is Carthage, and a Tyrian colony.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ph&oelig;nician Dido rules the growing state, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who fled from Tyre, to shun her brother's hate. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great were her wrongs, her story full of fate; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Which I will sum in short. Sich&aelig;us, known<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For wealth, and brother to the Punic throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Possessed fair Dido's bed; and either heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once was wounded with an equal dart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her father gave her, yet a spotless maid;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pygmalion then the Tyrian sceptre swayed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One who contemned divine and human laws.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then strife ensued, and cursed gold the cause.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The monarch, blinded with desire of wealth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With steel invades his brother's life by stealth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the sacred altar made him bleed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And long from her concealed the cruel deed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some tale, some new pretence, he daily coined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sooth his sister, and delude her mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length, in dead of night, the ghost appears <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of her unhappy lord: the spectre stares, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, with erected eyes, his bloody bosom bares. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cruel altars, and his fate, he tells,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the dire secret of his house reveals,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then warns the widow, and her household gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To seek a refuge in remote abodes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Last, to support her in so long a way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He shows her where his hidden treasure lay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Admonished thus, and seized with mortal fright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The queen provides companions of her flight:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They meet, and all combine to leave the state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who hate the tyrant, or who fear his hate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They seize a fleet, which ready rigged they find;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor is Pygmalion's treasure left behind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vessels, heavy laden, put to sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With prosperous winds; a woman leads the way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know not, if by stress of weather driven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or was their fatal course disposed by heaven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last they landed, where from far your eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May view the turrets of new Carthage rise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There bought a space of ground, which (Byrsa called,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the bull's hide) they first inclosed, and walled.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But whence are you? what country claims your birth?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What seek you, strangers, on our Libyan earth?"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To whom, with sorrow streaming from his eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And deeply sighing, thus her son replies:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Could you with patience hear, or I relate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O nymph! the tedious annals of our fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through such a train of woes if I should run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The day would sooner than the tale be done.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From ancient Troy, by force expelled, we came&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you by chance have heard the Trojan name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On various seas by various tempests tossed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length we landed on your Libyan coast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The good &AElig;neas am I called&mdash;a name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While Fortune favoured, not unknown to fame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My household gods, companions of my woes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With pious care I rescued from our foes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fruitful Italy my course was bent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the king of heaven is my descent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With twice ten sail I crossed the Phrygian sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fate and my mother goddess led my way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce seven, the thin remainders of my fleet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From storms preserved, within your harbour meet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Myself distressed, an exile, and unknown, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Debarred from Europe, and from Asia thrown, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Libyan deserts wander thus alone." <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">His tender parent could no longer bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, interposing, sought to sooth his care.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Whoe'er you are&mdash;not unbeloved by heaven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since on our friendly shore your ships are driven&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have courage: to the gods permit the rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the queen expose your just request.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now take this earnest of success, for more:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your scattered fleet is joined upon the shore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The winds are changed, your friends from danger free;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or I renounce my skill in augury.<br /></span>

    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Whom late the bird of Jove had driven along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And through the clouds pursued the scattering throng:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, all united in a goodly team,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They skim the ground, and seek the quiet stream.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As they, with joy returning, clap their wings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ride the circuit of the skies in rings;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not otherwise your ships, and every friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Already hold the port, or with swift sails descend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more advice is needful; but pursue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The path before you, and the town in view."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus having said, she turned, and made appear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her neck refulgent, and dishevelled hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, flowing from her shoulders, reached the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And widely spread ambrosial scents around.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In length of train descends her sweeping gown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, by her graceful walk, the queen of love is known.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The prince pursued the parting deity<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With words like these:&mdash;"Ah! whither do you fly?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unkind and cruel! to deceive your son<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In borrowed shapes, and his embrace to shun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never to bless my sight, but thus unknown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still to speak in accents not your own."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the goddess these complaints he made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But took the path, and her commands obeyed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They march obscure; for Venus kindly shrouds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With mists, their persons, and involves in clouds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, thus unseen, their passage none might stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or force to tell the causes of their way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This part performed, the goddess flies sublime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To visit Paphos, and her native clime;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where garlands, ever green and ever fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With vows are offered, and with solemn prayer:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hundred altars in her temple smoke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thousand bleeding hearts her power invoke.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
<span class="i2">They climb the next ascent, and, looking down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now at a nearer distance view the town.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The prince with wonder sees the stately towers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Which late were huts, and shepherds' homely bowers)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gates and streets; and hears, from every part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The noise and busy concourse of the mart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The toiling Tyrians on each other call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To ply their labour: some extend the wall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some build the citadel; the brawny throng<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or dig, or push unwieldy stones along.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some for their dwellings chuse a spot of ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, first designed, with ditches they surround.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some laws ordain; and some attend the choice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of holy senates, and elect by voice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here some design a mole, while others there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay deep foundations for a theatre,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From marble quarries mighty columns hew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ornaments of scenes, and future view.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such is their toil, and such their busy pains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As exercise the bees in flowery plains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When winter past, and summer scarce begun,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Some lead their youth abroad, while some condense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their liquid store, and some in cells dispense;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some at the gate stand ready to receive<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Their lofty towers: then entering at the gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Concealed in clouds, (prodigious to relate,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He mixed, unmarked, among the busy throng,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Borne by the tide, and passed unseen along.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Full in the centre of the town there stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thick set with trees, a venerable wood:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Tyrians, landing near this holy ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And digging here, a prosperous omen found:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From under earth a courser's head they drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their growth and future fortune to foreshew:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This fated sign their foundress Juno gave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a soil fruitful, and a people brave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sidonian Dido here with solemn state<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did Juno's temple build, and consecrate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enriched with gifts, and with a golden shrine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But more the goddess made the place divine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On brazen steps the marble threshold rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And brazen plates the cedar beams inclose:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rafters are with brazen coverings crowned;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lofty doors on brazen hinges sound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What first &AElig;neas in this place beheld,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Revived his courage, and his fear expelled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For&mdash;while, expecting there the queen, he raised<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His wondering eyes, and round the temple gazed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Admired the fortune of the rising town,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The striving artists, and their art's renown&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw, in order painted on the wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whatever did unhappy Troy befall&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wars that fame around the world had blown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All to the life, and every leader known.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There Agamemnon, Priam here, he spies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fierce Achilles, who both kings defies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He stopped, and weeping said,&mdash;"O friend! even here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The monuments of Trojan woes appear!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our known disasters fill even foreign lands:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See there, where old unhappy Priam stands!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even the mute walls relate the warrior's fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Trojan griefs the Tyrians pity claim."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said, (his tears a ready passage find,) <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Devouring what he saw so well designed, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with an empty picture fed his mind: <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
<span class="i0">For there he saw the fainting Grecians yield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here the trembling Trojans quit the field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pursued by fierce Achilles through the plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On his high chariot driving o'er the slain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tents of Rhesus next his grief renew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By their white sails betrayed to nightly view;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wakeful Diomede, whose cruel sword<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The centries slew, nor spared their slumbering lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then took the fiery steeds, ere yet the food<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Troy they taste, or drink the Xanthian flood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Elsewhere he saw where Tro&iuml;lus defied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Achilles, and unequal combat tried;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, where the boy disarmed, with loosened reins,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was by his horses hurried o'er the plains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hung by the neck and hair; and, dragged around, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hostile spear yet sticking in his wound, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tracks of blood inscribed the dusty ground. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime the Trojan dames, oppressed with woe, <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Pallas' fane in long procession go, <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In hopes to reconcile their heavenly foe. <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">They weep, they beat their breasts, they rend their hair, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rich embroidered vests for presents bear; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the stern goddess stands unmoved with prayer. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrice round the Trojan walls Achilles drew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The corpse of Hector, whom in fight he slew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here Priam sues; and there, for sums of gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lifeless body of his son is sold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So sad an object, and so well expressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drew sighs and groans from the grieved hero's breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see the figure of his lifeless friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his old sire his helpless hands extend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself he saw amidst the Grecian train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mixed in the bloody battle on the plain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And swarthy Memnon in his arms he knew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His pompous ensigns, and his Indian crew.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Penthesilea there, with haughty grace,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Fixed on the walls with wonder and surprise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beauteous Dido, with a numerous train,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Such on Eurotas' banks, or Cynthus' height,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Diana seems; and so she charms the sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When in the dance the graceful goddess leads<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The choir of nymphs, and overtops their heads.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Amidst the crowd, she walks serenely great.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their labour to her future sway she speeds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And passing with a gracious glance proceeds,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In crowds around, the swarming people join.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She takes petitions, and dispenses laws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hears and determines every private cause:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their tasks in equal portions she divides,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, where unequal, there by lot decides.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another way by chance &AElig;neas bends<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His eyes, and unexpected sees his friends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Antheus, Sergestus grave, Cloanthus strong,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at their backs a mighty Trojan throng,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom late the tempest on the billows tossed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And widely scattered on another coast.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The prince, unseen, surprised with wonder stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And longs, with joyful haste, to join their hands:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, doubtful of the wished event, he stays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the hollow cloud his friends surveys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Impatient till they told their present state,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And why they came, and what was their request;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For these were sent commissioned by the rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sue for leave to land their sickly men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gain admission to the gracious queen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Entering, with cries they filled the holy fane;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then thus, with lowly voice, Ilioneus began:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O queen! indulged by favour of the gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To found an empire in these new abodes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To build a town, with statutes to restrain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wild inhabitants beneath thy reign&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We wretched Trojans, tossed on every shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From sea to sea, thy clemency implore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forbid the fires our shipping to deface! <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Receive the unhappy fugitives to grace, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spare the remnant of a pious race! <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">We come not with design of wasteful prey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To drive the country, force the swains away:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor such our strength, nor such is our desire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vanquished dare not to such thoughts aspire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A land there is, Hesperia named of old&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soil is fruitful, and the men are bold&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The &OElig;notrians held it once&mdash;by common fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now called Italia, from the leader's name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To that sweet region was our voyage bent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When winds, and every warring element,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disturbed our course, and, far from sight of land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cast our torn vessels on the moving sand:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sea came on; the South, with mighty roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dispersed and dashed the rest upon the rocky shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those few you see escaped the storm, and fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unless you interpose, a shipwreck here.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
<span class="i0">What men, what monsters, what inhuman race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What laws, what barbarous customs of the place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shut up a desert shore to drowning men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drive us to the cruel seas again?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If our hard fortune no compassion draws, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor hospitable rights, nor human laws, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gods are just, and will revenge our cause. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">&AElig;neas was our prince&mdash;a juster lord, <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or nobler warrior, never drew a sword&mdash; <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Observant of the right, religious of his word. <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">If yet he lives, and draws this vital air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor we, his friends, of safety shall despair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor you, great queen, these offices repent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which he will equal, and perhaps augment.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We want not cities, nor Sicilian coasts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where king Acestes Trojan lineage boasts.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Permit our ships a shelter on your shores,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Refitted from your woods with planks and oars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, if our prince be safe, we may renew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our destined course, and Italy pursue.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if, O best of men! the Fates ordain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thou art swallowed in the Libyan main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if our young I&uuml;lus be no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dismiss our navy from your friendly shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That we to good Acestes may return,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with our friends our common losses mourn."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus spoke Ilioneus: the Trojan crew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With cries and clamours his request renew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The modest queen a while, with downcast eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pondered the speech, then briefly thus replies:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Trojans! dismiss your fears; my cruel fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And doubts attending an unsettled state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Force me to guard my coast from foreign foes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who has not heard the story of your woes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The name and fortune of your native place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fame and valour of the Phrygian race?<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
<span class="i0">We Tyrians are not so devoid of sense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor so remote from Ph&oelig;bus' influence.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether to Latian shores your course is bent, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, driven by tempests from your first intent, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">You seek the good Acestes' government, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your men shall be received, your fleet repaired,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sail, with ships of convoy for your guard:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, would you stay, and join your friendly powers <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To raise and to defend the Tyrian towers, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">My wealth, my city, and myself, are yours. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And would to heaven, the storm, you felt, would bring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Carthaginian coasts your wandering king.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My people shall, by my command, explore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ports and creeks of every winding shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And towns, and wilds, and shady woods, in quest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of so renowned and so desired a guest."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Raised in his mind the Trojan hero stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And longed to break from out his ambient cloud;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Achates found it, and thus urged his way:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"From whence, O goddess-born, this long delay?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What more can you desire, your welcome sure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your fleet in safety, and your friend secure?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One only wants; and him we saw in vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oppose the storm, and swallowed in the main.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Orontes in his fate our forfeit paid;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rest agrees with what your mother said."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce had he spoken, when the cloud gave way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mists flew upward, and dissolved in day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Trojan chief appeared in open sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">August in visage, and serenely bright.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His mother goddess, with her hands divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had formed his curling locks, and made his temples shine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And given his rolling eyes a sparkling grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And breathed a youthful vigour on his face;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Like polished ivory, beauteous to behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or Parian marble, when enchased in gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus radiant from the circling cloud he broke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus with manly modesty he spoke:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"He whom you seek am I; by tempests tossed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saved from shipwreck on your Libyan coast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Presenting, gracious queen, before your throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A prince that owes his life to you alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair majesty! the refuge and redress<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of those whom Fate pursues, and wants oppress!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You, who your pious offices employ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To save the reliques of abandoned Troy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Receive the shipwrecked on your friendly shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With hospitable rites relieve the poor;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Associate in your town a wandering train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strangers in your palace entertain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What thanks can wretched fugitives return,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, scattered through the world, in exile mourn?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gods, (if gods to goodness are inclined&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If acts of mercy touch their heavenly mind,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, more than all the gods, your generous heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conscious of worth, requite its own desert!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In you this age is happy, and this earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And parents more than mortal gave you birth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While rolling rivers into seas shall run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And round the space of heaven the radiant sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While trees the mountain-tops with shades supply,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your honour, name, and praise, shall never die.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whate'er abode my fortune has assigned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your image shall be present in my mind."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus having said, he turned with pious haste, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And joyful his expecting friends embraced: <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his right hand Ilioneus he graced,<a id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Admired his fortunes, more admired the man;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then recollected stood, and thus began:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What fate, O goddess-born! what angry powers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have cast you shipwrecked on our barren shores?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are you the great &AElig;neas, known to fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who from celestial seed your lineage claim?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The same &AElig;neas, whom fair Venus bore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To famed Anchises on the Id&aelig;an shore?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It calls into my mind, though then a child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Teucer came, from Salamis exiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sought my father's aid, to be restored:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My father Belus then with fire and sword<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Invaded Cyprus, made the region bare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, conquering, finished the successful war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From him the Trojan siege I understood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Grecian chiefs, and your illustrious blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your foe himself the Dardan valour praised,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his own ancestry from Trojans raised.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enter, my noble guest! and you shall find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If not a costly welcome, yet a kind:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I myself, like you, have been distressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till heaven afforded me this place of rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like you, an alien in a land unknown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I learn to pity woes so like my own."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She said, and to the palace led her guest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then offered incense, and proclaimed a feast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor yet less careful for her absent friends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twice ten fat oxen to the ships she sends;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besides a hundred boars, a hundred lambs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With bleating cries, attend their milky dams;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And jars of generous wine, and spacious bowls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She gives, to cheer the sailors' drooping souls.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Now purple hangings clothe the palace-walls,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">On Tyrian carpets, richly wrought, they dine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With loads of massy plate the side-boards shine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And antique vases, all of gold embossed,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The fights and figures of illustrious men, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">From their first founder to the present queen. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">The good &AElig;neas, whose paternal care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I&uuml;lus' absence could no longer bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dispatched Achates to the ships in haste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To give a glad relation of the past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, fraught with precious gifts, to bring the boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Snatched from the ruins of unhappy Troy&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A robe of tissue, stiff with golden wire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An upper vest, once Helen's rich attire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Argos by the famed adultress brought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With golden flowers and winding foliage wrought&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her mother Leda's present, when she came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To ruin Troy, and set the world on flame;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">One order set with gems, and one with gold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Instructed thus, the wise Achates goes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, in his diligence, his duty shows.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But Venus, anxious for her son's affairs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New counsels tries, and new designs prepares:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Should bring the presents, in her nephew's stead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in Eliza's veins the gentle poison shed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For much she feared the Tyrians, double-tongued,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And knew the town to Juno's care belonged.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These thoughts by night her golden slumbers broke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus, alarmed, to winged Love she spoke:&mdash;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"My son, my strength, whose mighty power alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Controuls the Thunderer on his awful throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To thee thy much-afflicted mother flies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on thy succour and thy faith relies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou know'st, my son, how Jove's revengeful wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By force and fraud, attempts thy brother's life;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And often hast thou mourned with me his pains. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Him Dido now with blandishment detains; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I suspect the town where Juno reigns. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this, 'tis needful to prevent her art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fire with love the proud Ph&oelig;nician's heart&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A love so violent, so strong, so sure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That neither age can change, nor art can cure.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How this may be performed, now take my mind:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ascanius, by his father is designed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To come, with presents laden, from the port,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To gratify the queen, and gain the court.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I mean to plunge the boy in pleasing sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, ravished, in Idalian bowers to keep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or high Cythera, that the sweet deceit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May pass unseen, and none prevent the cheat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take thou his form and shape. I beg the grace, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But only for a night's revolving space, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thyself a boy, assume a boy's dissembled face; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That when, amidst the fervour of the feast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Tyrian hugs and fonds thee on her breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with sweet kisses in her arms constrains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou may'st infuse thy venom in her veins."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The god of love obeys, and sets aside<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His bow and quiver, and his plumy pride;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He walks I&uuml;lus in his mother's sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the sweet resemblance takes delight.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The goddess then to young Ascanius flies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in a pleasing slumber seals his eyes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lulled in her lap, amidst a train of Loves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She gently bears him to her blissful groves,<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then with a wreath of myrtle crowns his head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And softly lays him on a flowery bed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cupid meantime assumed his form and face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Following Achates with a shorter pace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And brought the gifts. The queen already sate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amidst the Trojan lords, in shining state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High on a golden bed: her princely guest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was next her side;<a id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> in order sate the rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then canisters with bread are heaped on high; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The attendants water for their hands supply, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, having washed, with silken towels dry. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next fifty handmaids in long order bore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The censers, and with fumes the gods adore:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then youths and virgins, twice as many, join<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To place the dishes, and to serve the wine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Tyrian train, admitted to the feast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Approach, and on the painted couches rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All on the Trojan gifts with wonder gaze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But view the beauteous boy with more amaze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His rosy-coloured cheeks, his radiant eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His motions, voice, and shape, and all the god's disguise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor pass unpraised the vest and veil divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which wandering foliage and rich flowers entwine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, far above the rest, the royal dame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Already doomed to love's disastrous flame,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With eyes insatiate, and tumultuous joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beholds the presents, and admires the boy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The guileful god, about the hero long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With children's play, and false embraces, hung;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then sought the queen: she took him to her arms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With greedy pleasure, and devoured his charms.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unhappy Dido little thought what guest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How dire a god, she drew so near her breast.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But he, not mindless of his mother's prayer, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Works in the pliant bosom of the fair, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And moulds her heart anew, and blots her former care. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dead is to the living love resigned;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all &AElig;neas enters in her mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now, when the rage of hunger was appeased,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The meat removed, and every guest was pleased,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The golden bowls with sparkling wine are crowned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And through the palace cheerful cries resound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From gilded roofs depending lamps display<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nocturnal beams, that emulate the day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A golden bowl, that shone with gems divine, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The queen commanded to be crowned with wine&mdash; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bowl that Belus used, and all the Tyrian line. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, silence through the hall proclaimed, she spoke:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O hospitable Jove! we thus invoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With solemn rites, thy sacred name and power;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bless to both nations this auspicious hour!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So may the Trojan and the Tyrian line<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In lasting concord from this day combine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou, Bacchus, god of joys and friendly cheer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gracious Juno, both be present here!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you, my lords of Tyre, your vows address<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To heaven with mine, to ratify the peace."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The goblet then she took, with nectar crowned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Sprinkling the first libations on the ground,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And raised it to her mouth with sober grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, sipping, offered to the next in place.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas Bitias whom she called&mdash;a thirsty soul;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He took the challenge, and embraced the bowl,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With pleasure swilled the gold, nor ceased to draw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till he the bottom of the brimmer saw.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The goblet goes around: I&ouml;pas brought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His golden lyre, and sung what ancient Atlas taught&mdash;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The various labours of the wandering moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whence proceed the eclipses of the sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The original of men and beasts; and whence <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rains arise, and fires their warmth dispense, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fixed and erring stars dispose their influence; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">What shakes the solid earth; what cause delays<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The summer nights, and shortens winter days.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With peals of shouts the Tyrians praise the song;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those peals are echoed by the Trojan throng.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The unhappy queen with talk prolonged the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drank large draughts of love with vast delight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Priam much inquired, of Hector more; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then asked what arms the swarthy Memnon wore, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">What troops he landed on the Trojan shore; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The steeds of Diomede varied the discourse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fierce Achilles, with his matchless force;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length, as Fate and her ill stars required,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hear the series of the war desired.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Relate at large, my god-like guest," she said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The Grecian stratagems, the town betrayed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fatal issue of so long a war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your flight, your wanderings, and your woes, declare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, since on every sea, on every coast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your men have been distressed, your navy tossed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seven times the sun has either tropic viewed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The winter banished, and the spring renewed."<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p class="pmb3">Poetically speaking, the <i>fields of air</i> are under the command of
Juno, and her vicegerent &AElig;olus. Why then does Neptune call
them his? I answer, Because, being god of the seas, &AElig;olus could
raise no tempest in the atmosphere above them without his leave.
But why does Juno address to her own substitute? I answer, He
had an immediate power over the winds, whom Juno desires to
employ on her revenge. That power was absolute by land; which
Virgil plainly insinuates: for, when Boreas and his brethren were
let loose, he says at first, <i>terras turbine perflant</i>&mdash;then adds, <i>Incubuere
mari</i>. To raise a tempest on the sea, was usurpation on the
prerogative of Neptune, who had given him no leave, and therefore
was enraged at his attempt. I may also add, that they who
are in a passion, as Neptune then was, are apt to assume to themselves
more than is properly their due.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="ii1 pmb2"><i>&AElig;neas relates how the city of Troy was taken, after a ten years'
siege, by the treachery of Sinon, and the stratagem of a wooden
horse. He declares the fixed resolution he had taken not to survive
the ruin of his country, and the various adventures he met
with in the defence of it. At last, having been before advised by
Hector's ghost, and now by the appearance of his mother Venus,
he is prevailed upon to leave the town, and settle his household
gods in another country. In order to do this, he carries off his
father on his shoulders, and leads his little son by the hand,
his wife following him behind. When he comes to the place
appointed for the general rendezvous, he finds a great confluence
of people, but misses his wife, whose ghost afterwards
appears to him, and tells him the land which was designed
for him.</i><a id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<span class="i0">All were attentive to the godlike man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When from his lofty couch he thus began:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Great queen, what you command me to relate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Renews the sad remembrance of our fate:<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
<span class="i0">An empire from its old foundations rent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every woe the Trojans underwent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A peopled city made a desert place;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All that I saw, and part of which I was;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not even the hardest of our foes could hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor stern Ulysses tell, without a tear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now the latter watch of wasting night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And setting stars, to kindly rest invite.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, since you take such interest in our woe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Troy's disastrous end desire to know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will restrain my tears, and briefly tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What in our last and fatal night befell.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By destiny compelled, and in despair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Greeks grew weary of the tedious war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, by Minerva's aid, a fabric reared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which like a steed of monstrous height appeared:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sides were planked with pine: they feigned it made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For their return, and this the vow they paid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus they pretend, but in the hollow side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Selected numbers of their soldiers hide:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With inward arms the dire machine they load,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And iron bowels stuff the dark abode.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sight of Troy lies Tenedos, an isle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(While Fortune did on Priam's empire smile)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Renowned for wealth; but, since, a faithless bay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where ships exposed to wind and weather lay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was their fleet concealed. We thought, for Greece<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their sails were hoisted, and our fears release.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Trojans, cooped within their walls so long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unbar their gates, and issue in a throng,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like swarming bees, and with delight survey<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The camp deserted, where the Grecians lay:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The quarters of the several chiefs they showed&mdash; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here Ph&oelig;nix, here Achilles, made abode; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here joined the battles; there the navy rode. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Part on the pile their wondering eyes employ&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pile by Pallas raised to ruin Troy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thym&oelig;tes first ('tis doubtful whether hired,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or so the Trojan destiny required)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moved, that the ramparts might be broken down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lodge the monster fabric in the town.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Capys, and the rest of sounder mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fatal present to the flames designed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or to the watery deep; at least to bore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hollow sides, and hidden frauds explore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The giddy vulgar, as their fancies guide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With noise say nothing, and in parts divide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laoco&ouml;n, followed by a numerous crowd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ran from the fort, and cried, from far, aloud:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O wretched countrymen! what fury reigns?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What more than madness has possessed your brains?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Think you the Grecians from your coasts are gone?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And are Ulysses' arts no better known?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This hollow fabric either must inclose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within its blind recess, our secret foes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or 'tis an engine raised above the town,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To o'erlook the walls, and then to batter down.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Somewhat is sure designed, by fraud or force&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trust not their presents, nor admit the horse."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus having said, against the steed he threw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His forceful spear, which, hissing as it flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pierced through the yielding planks of jointed wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And trembling in the hollow belly stood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sides, transpierced, return a rattling sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And groans of Greeks inclosed come issuing through the wound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, had not heaven the fall of Troy designed, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or had not men been fated to be blind, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enough was said and done to inspire a better mind. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then had our lances pierced the treacherous wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Ilian towers and Priam's empire stood.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime, with shouts, the Trojan shepherds bring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A captive Greek in bands, before the king&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Taken, to take&mdash;who made himself their prey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To impose on their belief, and Troy betray;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fixed on his aim, and obstinately bent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To die undaunted, or to circumvent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About the captive, tides of Trojans flow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All press to see, and some insult the foe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now hear how well the Greeks their wiles disguised;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold a nation in a man comprised.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trembling the miscreant stood; unarmed and bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He stared, and rolled his hagard eyes around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then said, "Alas! what earth remains, what sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is open to receive unhappy me?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What fate a wretched fugitive attends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scorned by my foes, abandoned by my friends?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said, and sighed, and cast a rueful eye;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our pity kindles, and our passions die.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We cheer the youth to make his own defence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And freely tell us what he was, and whence:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What news he could impart, we long to know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what to credit from a captive foe.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His fear at length dismissed, he said,&mdash;"Whate'er<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My fate ordains, my words shall be sincere:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I neither can nor dare my birth disclaim;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Greece is my country, Sinon is my name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though plunged by Fortune's power in misery,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis not in Fortune's power to make me lie.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If any chance has hither brought the name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Palamedes, not unknown to fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who suffered from the malice of the times,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Accused and sentenced for pretended crimes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because the fatal wars he would prevent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose death the wretched Greeks too late lament&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">While Fortune favoured, while his arms support<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cause, and ruled the counsels of the court,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I made some figure there; nor was my name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Obscure, nor I without my share of fame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when Ulysses, with fallacious arts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had made impression in the people's hearts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And forged a treason in my patron's name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(I speak of things too far divulged by fame,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My kinsman fell. Then I, without support,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In private mourned his loss, and left the court.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mad as I was, I could not bear his fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With silent grief, but loudly blamed the state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cursed the direful author of my woes.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas told again; and hence my ruin rose.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His death with double vengeance to restore. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">This moved the murderer's hate; and soon ensued<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The effects of malice from a man so proud.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ambiguous rumours through the camp he spread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sought, by treason, my devoted head;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To make my guilt appear, and hide his own;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till Calchas was by force and threatening wrought&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But why&mdash;why dwell I on that anxious thought?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If on my nation just revenge you seek,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">My death will both the kingly brothers please,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Raised expectations in our longing hearts; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unknowing as we were in Grecian arts. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His former trembling once again renewed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With acted fear, the villain thus pursued:&mdash;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"Long had the Grecians (tired with fruitless care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wearied with an unsuccessful war)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resolved to raise the siege, and leave the town;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, had the gods permitted, they had gone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But oft the wintery seas, and southern winds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Withstood their passage home, and changed their minds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Portents and prodigies their souls amazed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But most, when this stupendous pile was raised:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then flaming meteors, hung in air, were seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thunders rattled through a sky serene.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dismayed, and fearful of some dire event,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eurypylus, to inquire their fate, was sent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He from the gods this dreadful answer brought: <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">'O Grecians, when the Trojan shores you sought, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your passage with a virgin's blood was bought: <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">So must your safe return be bought again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Grecian blood once more atone the main.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spreading rumour round the people ran;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All feared, and each believed himself the man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ulysses took the advantage of their fright;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Called Calchas, and produced in open sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then bade him name the wretch, ordained by fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The public victim, to redeem the state.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Already some presaged the dire event,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And saw what sacrifice Ulysses meant.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For twice five days the good old seer withstood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The intended treason, and was dumb to blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till, tired with endless clamours and pursuit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Ithacus, he stood no longer mute,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, as it was agreed, pronounced that I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was destined by the wrathful gods to die.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All praised the sentence, pleased the storm should fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On one alone, whose fury threatened all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dismal day was come; the priests prepare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their leavened cakes, and fillets for my hair.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
<span class="i0">I followed nature's laws, and must avow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I broke my bonds, and fled the fatal blow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hid in a weedy lake all night I lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secure of safety when they sailed away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now what further hopes for me remain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see my friends, or native soil, again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My tender infants, or my careful sire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom they returning will to death require;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will perpetrate on them their first design,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And take the forfeit of their heads for mine?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, O! if pity mortal minds can move,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If there be faith below, or gods above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If innocence and truth can claim desert,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye Trojans, from an injured wretch avert."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">False tears true pity move; the king commands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To loose his fetters, and unbind his hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then adds these friendly words:&mdash;"Dismiss thy fears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forget the Greeks; be mine as thou wert theirs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But truly tell, was it for force or guile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or some religious end, you raised the pile?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus said the king.&mdash;He, full of fraudful arts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This well-invented tale for truth imparts:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Ye lamps of heaven!" he said, and lifted high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hands now free,&mdash;"thou venerable sky!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inviolable powers, adored with dread! <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye fatal fillets, that once bound this head! <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye sacred altars, from whose flames I fled! <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be all of you adjured; and grant I may,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without a crime, the ungrateful Greeks betray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reveal the secrets of the guilty state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And justly punish whom I justly hate!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But you, O king, preserve the faith you gave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I, to save myself, your empire save.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Grecian hopes, and all the attempts they made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were only founded on Minerva's aid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But from the time when impious Diomede,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And false Ulysses, that inventive head,<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Her fatal image from the temple drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sleeping guardians of the castle slew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her virgin statue with their bloody hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Polluted, and profaned her holy bands;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From thence the tide of fortune left their shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ebbed much faster than it flowed before:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their courage languished, as their hopes decayed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Pallas, now averse, refused her aid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor did the goddess doubtfully declare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her altered mind, and alienated care.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When first her fatal image touched the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She sternly cast her glaring eyes around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That sparkled as they rolled, and seemed to threat:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her heavenly limbs distilled a briny sweat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrice from the ground she leaped, was seen to wield<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her brandished lance, and shake her horrid shield.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Calchas bade our host for flight prepare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hope no conquest from the tedious war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till first they sailed for Greece; with prayers besought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her injured power, and better omens brought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now their navy ploughs the watery main, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet soon expect it on your shores again, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Pallas pleased; as Calchas did ordain. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But first, to reconcile the blue-eyed maid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For her stolen statue and her tower betrayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warned by the seer, to her offended name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We raised and dedicate this wonderous frame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So lofty, lest through your forbidden gates<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It pass, and intercept our better fates:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, once admitted there, our hopes are lost;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Troy may then a new Palladium boast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For so religion and the gods ordain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, if you violate with hands profane<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Minerva's gift, your town in flames shall burn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Which omen, O ye gods, on Gr&aelig;cia turn!)<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then Troy shall Argos and Mycen&aelig; burn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the reverse of fate on us return."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With such deceits he gained their easy hearts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too prone to credit his perfidious arts.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What Diomede, nor Thetis' greater son,            }<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thousand ships, nor ten years' siege, had done&mdash;}<br /></span>
<span class="i0">False tears and fawning words the city won.       }<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A greater omen, and of worse portent, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did our unwary minds with fear torment, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Concurring to produce the dire event. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laoco&ouml;n, Neptune's priest by lot that year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With solemn pomp then sacrificed a steer;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When (dreadful to behold!) from sea we spied <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two serpents, ranked abreast, the seas divide, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smoothly sweep along the swelling tide. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their flaming crests above the waves they show;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their bellies seem to burn the seas below;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their speckled tails advance to steer their course,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the sounding shore the flying billows force.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now the strand, and now the plain, they held.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their ardent eyes with bloody streaks were filled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their nimble tongues they brandished as they came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And licked their hissing jaws, that sputtered flame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We fled amazed; their destined way they take,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to Laoco&ouml;n and his children make;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And first around the tender boys they wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then with their sharpened fangs their limbs and bodies grind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wretched father, running to their aid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With pious haste, but vain, they next invade;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twice round his waist their winding volumes rolled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And twice about his gasping throat they fold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The priest thus doubly choked&mdash;their crests divide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And towering o'er his head in triumph ride.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With both his hands he labours at the knots;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His holy fillets the blue venom blots;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His roaring fills the flitting air around.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus, when an ox receives a glancing wound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He breaks his bands, the fatal altar flies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with loud bellowings breaks the yielding skies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their tasks performed, the serpents quit their prey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the tower of Pallas make their way:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Couched at her feet, they lie protected there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By her large buckler, and protended spear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amazement seizes all; the general cry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proclaims Laoco&ouml;n justly doomed to die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose hand the will of Pallas had withstood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dared to violate the sacred wood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All vote to admit the steed, that vows be paid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And incense offered, to the offended maid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A spacious breach is made; the town lies bare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some hoisting-levers, some the wheels, prepare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fasten to the horses feet; the rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With cables haul along the unwieldy beast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each on his fellow for assistance calls;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length the fatal fabric mounts the walls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Big with destruction. Boys with chaplets crowned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And choirs of virgins, sing and dance around.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus raised aloft, and then descending down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It enters o'er our heads, and threats the town.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O sacred city, built by hands divine!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O valiant heroes of the Trojan line!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Four times he struck; as oft the clashing sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of arms was heard, and inward groans rebound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, mad with zeal, and blinded with our fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We haul along the horse in solemn state;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then place the dire portent within the tower.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cassandra cried, and cursed the unhappy hour;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Foretold our fate; but, by the god's decree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All heard, and none believed the prophecy.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>

<span class="i2">'Twas in the dead of night, when sleep repairs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our bodies worn with toils, our minds with cares,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Hector's ghost before my sight appears:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Such as he was, when, by Pelides slain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thessalian coursers dragged him o'er the plain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swoln were his feet, as when the thongs were thrust<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Unlike that Hector, who returned, from toils<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And launched against their navy Phrygian fire.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
<span class="i0">His hair and beard stood stiffened with his gore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the wounds he for his country bore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now streamed afresh, and with new purple ran. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wept to see the visionary man, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, while my trance continued, thus began:&mdash; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O light of Trojans, and support of Troy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy father's champion, and thy country's joy!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O, long expected by thy friends! from whence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Art thou so late returned for our defence?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do we behold thee, wearied as we are,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With length of labours, and with toils of war?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After so many funerals of thy own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Art thou restored to thy declining town?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But say, what wounds are these? what new disgrace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deforms the manly features of thy face?"<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To this the spectre no reply did frame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But answered to the cause for which he came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, groaning from the bottom of his breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This warning, in these mournful words, expressed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O goddess-born! escape, by timely flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flames and horrors of this fatal night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The foes already have possessed the wall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Troy nods from high, and totters to her fall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enough is paid to Priam's royal name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More than enough to duty and to fame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If by a mortal hand my father's throne<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could be defended, 'twas by mine alone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now Troy to thee commends her future state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gives her gods companions of thy fate:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From their assistance, happier walls expect,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, wandering long, at last thou shalt erect."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said, and brought me, from their blest abodes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The venerable statues of the gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With ancient Vesta from the sacred choir,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wreaths and reliques of the immortal fire.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now peals of shouts come thundering from afar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cries, threats, and loud laments, and mingled war:<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The noise approaches, though our palace stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aloof from streets, encompassed with a wood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Louder, and yet more loud, I hear the alarms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of human cries distinct, and clashing arms.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fear broke my slumbers; I no longer stay, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But mount the terrace, thence the town survey, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hearken what the frightful sounds convey. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus, when a flood of fire by wind is borne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crackling it rolls, and mows the standing corn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or deluges, descending on the plains, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweep o'er the yellow year, destroy the pains <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">The shepherd climbs the cliff, and sees from far<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wasteful ravage of the watery war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Hector's faith was manifestly cleared,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The palace of De&iuml;phobus ascends<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"What hope, O Panth&ucirc;s? whither can we run?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where make a stand? and what may yet be done?"<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce had I said, when Panth&ucirc;s, with a groan,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Troy is no more, and Ilium was a town!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fatal day, the appointed hour, is come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When wrathful Jove's irrevocable doom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Transfers the Trojan state to Grecian hands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fire consumes the town, the foe commands;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And armed hosts, an unexpected force,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Break from the bowels of the fatal horse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within the gates, proud Sinon throws about<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flames; and foes, for entrance, press without,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With thousand others, whom I fear to name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More than from Argos or Mycen&aelig; came.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To several posts their parties they divide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some block the narrow streets, some scour the wide:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bold they kill, the unwary they surprise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who fights finds death, and death finds him who flies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The warders of the gate but scarce maintain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The unequal combat, and resist in vain."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I heard; and heaven, that well-born souls inspires,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prompts me, through lifted swords and rising fires,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To run, where clashing arms and clamour calls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rush undaunted to defend the walls.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ripheus and Iphitus by my side engage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For valour one renowned, and one for age.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dymas and Hypanis by moonlight knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My motions and my mien, and to my party drew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With young Chor&oelig;bus, who by love was led<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To win renown, and fair Cassandra's bed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lately brought his troops to Priam's aid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forewarned in vain by the prophetic maid:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom when I saw resolved in arms to fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that one spirit animated all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Brave souls!" said I,&mdash;"but brave, alas! in vain&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, finish what our cruel fates ordain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You see the desperate state of our affairs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heaven's protecting powers are deaf to prayers.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The passive gods behold the Greeks defile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their temples, and abandon to the spoil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their own abodes: we, feeble few, conspire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To save a sinking town, involved in fire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then let us fall, but fall amidst our foes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Despair of life the means of living shows."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So bold a speech encouraged their desire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of death, and added fuel to their fire.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As hungry wolves, with raging appetite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scour through the fields, nor fear the stormy night&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their whelps at home expect the promised food,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And long to temper their dry chaps in blood&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So rushed we forth at once: resolved to die,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resolved, in death, the last extremes to try,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We leave the narrow lanes behind, and dare <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The unequal combat in the public square: <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Night was our friend; our leader was despair. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">What tongue can tell the slaughter of that night?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What eyes can weep the sorrows and affright?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An ancient and imperial city falls;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The streets are filled with frequent funerals;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Houses and holy temples float in blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hostile nations make a common flood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not only Trojans fall; but, in their turn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vanquished triumph, and the victors mourn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ours take new courage from despair and night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confused the fortune is, confused the fight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All parts resound with tumults, plaints, and fears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And grisly Death in sundry shapes appears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Androgeos fell among us, with his band,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who thought us Grecians newly come to land.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"From whence," said he, "my friends, this long delay?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You loiter, while the spoils are borne away:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our ships are laden with the Trojan store;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you, like truants, come too late ashore."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said, but soon corrected his mistake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Found, by the doubtful answers which we make.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Amazed, he would have shunned the unequal fight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But we, more numerous, intercept his flight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when some peasant in a bushy brake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has with unwary footing pressed a snake;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He starts aside, astonished, when he spies <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His rising crest, blue neck, and rolling eyes; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, from our arms, surprised Androgeos flies&mdash; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain; for him and his we compass round, <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Possessed with fear, unknowing of the ground, <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of their lives an easy conquest found. <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus Fortune on our first endeavour smiled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chor&oelig;bus then, with youthful hopes beguiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swoln with success, and of a daring mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This new invention fatally designed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"My friends," said he, "since Fortune shows the way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis fit we should the auspicious guide obey.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For what has she these Grecian arms bestowed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But their destruction, and the Trojans' good?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then change we shields, and their devices bear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let fraud supply the want of force in war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They find us arms." This said, himself he dressed <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In dead Androgeos' spoils, his upper vest, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His painted buckler, and his plumy crest. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus Ripheus, Dymas, all the Trojan train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay down their own attire, and strip the slain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mixed with the Greeks, we go with ill presage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flattered with hopes to glut our greedy rage;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unknown, assaulting whom we blindly meet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strew, with Grecian carcases, the street.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus while their straggling parties we defeat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some to the shore and safer ships retreat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some, oppressed with more ignoble fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remount the hollow horse, and pant in secret there.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But, ah! what use of valour can be made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When heaven's propitious powers refuse their aid?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold the royal prophetess, the fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cassandra, dragged by her dishevelled hair,<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Whom not Minerva's shrine, nor sacred bands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In safety could protect from sacrilegious hands:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On heaven she cast her eyes, she sighed, she cried&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas all she could&mdash;her tender arms were tied.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So sad a sight Chor&oelig;bus could not bear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, fired with rage, distracted with despair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the barbarous ravishers he flew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our leader's rash example we pursue:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But storms of stones, from the proud temple's height,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pour down, and on our battered helms alight:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We from our friends received this fatal blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who thought us Grecians, as we seemed in show.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They aim at the mistaken crests, from high;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ours beneath the ponderous ruin lie.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, moved with anger and disdain, to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their troops dispersed, the royal virgin free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Grecians rally, and their powers unite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fury charge us, and renew the fight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The brother kings with Ajax join their force,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the whole squadron of Thessalian horse.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thus, when the rival winds their quarrel try,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Contending for the kingdom of the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">South, east, and west, on airy coursers borne&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The whirlwind gathers, and the woods are torn:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Nereus strikes the deep: the billows rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, mixed with ooze and sand, pollute the skies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The troops we squandered first, again appear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From several quarters, and inclose the rear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They first observe, and to the rest betray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our different speech; our borrowed arms survey.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oppressed with odds, we fall; Chor&oelig;bus first,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At Pallas' altar, by Peneleus pierced.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Ripheus followed, in the unequal fight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just of his word, observant of the right:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaven thought not so. Dymas their fate attends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Hypanis, mistaken by their friends.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Nor, Panth&ucirc;s, thee thy mitre, nor the bands<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ye Trojan flames! your testimony bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What I performed, and what I suffered there;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sword avoiding in the fatal strife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exposed to death, and prodigal of life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Witness, ye heavens! I live not by my fault:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I strove to have deserved the death I sought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, when I could not fight, and would have died,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Borne off to distance by the growing tide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Iphitus and I were hurried thence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Pelias wounded, and without defence.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New clamours from the invested palace ring:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We run to die, or disengage the king.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So hot the assault, so high the tumult rose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While ours defend, and while the Greeks oppose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As all the Dardan and Argolic race<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had been contracted in that narrow space;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or as all Ilium else were void of fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tumult, war, and slaughter, only there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their targets in a tortoise cast, the foes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secure advancing, to the turrets rose:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some mount the scaling-ladders; some, more bold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swerve upwards, and by posts and pillars hold:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their left hand gripes their bucklers in the ascent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While with the right they seize the battlement.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the demolished towers, the Trojans throw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Huge heaps of stones, that, falling, crush the foe:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heavy beams and rafters from the sides,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And gilded roofs, come tumbling from on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The marks of state, and ancient royalty.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The guards below, fixed in the pass, attend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The charge undaunted, and the gate defend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Renewed in courage with recovered breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A second time we ran to tempt our death,<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
<span class="i0">To clear the palace from the foe, succeed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The weary living, and revenge the dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A postern-door, yet unobserved and free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Joined by the length of a blind gallery,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the king's closet led&mdash;a way well known<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Hector's wife, while Priam held the throne&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through which she brought Astyanax, unseen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To cheer his grandsire, and his grandsire's queen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through this we pass, and mount the tower, from whence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With unavailing arms the Trojans make defence.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From this the trembling king had oft descried<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Grecian camp, and saw their navy ride.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beams from its lofty height with swords we hew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, wrenching with our hands, the assault renew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, where the rafters on the columns meet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We push them headlong with our arms and feet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lightning flies not swifter than the fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor thunder louder than the ruined wall:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down goes the top at once; the Greeks beneath<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Yet more succeed, and more to death are sent:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We cease not from above, nor they below relent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the gate stood Pyrrhus, threatening loud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With glittering arms conspicuous in the crowd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So shines, renewed in youth, the crested snake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who slept the winter in a thorny brake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, casting off his slough when spring returns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now looks aloft, and with new glory burns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Restored with poisonous herbs; his ardent sides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reflect the sun; and, raised on spires, he rides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High o'er the grass: hissing he rolls along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And brandishes by fits his forky tongue.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proud Periphas, and fierce Automedon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His father's charioteer, together run<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To force the gate: the Scyrian infantry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rush on in crowds, and the barred passage free.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Entering the court, with shouts the skies they rend;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flaming firebrands to the roofs ascend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself, among the foremost, deals his blows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with his axe repeated strokes bestows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the strong doors; then all their shoulders ply,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till from the posts the brazen hinges fly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He hews apace: the double bars at length<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yield to his axe, and unresisted strength.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mighty breach is made: the rooms concealed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Appear, and all the palace is revealed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The halls of audience, and of public state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where the lonely queen in secret sate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Armed soldiers now by trembling maids are seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With not a door, and scarce a space, between.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The house is filled with loud laments and cries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shrieks of women rend the vaulted skies.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The fifty nuptial beds, (such hopes had he,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The posts of plated gold, and hung with spoils,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Despairing of success, ambitious to be slain! <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uncovered but by heaven, there stood in view<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An altar: near the hearth a laurel grew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dodder'd with age, whose boughs encompass round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The household gods, and shade the holy ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here Hecuba, with all her helpless train<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of dames, for shelter sought, but sought in vain.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Their images they hug, and to their altars fly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The queen, when she beheld her trembling lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hanging by his side a heavy sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What rage," she cried, "has seized my husband's mind?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What arms are these, and to what use designed?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These times want other aids! Were Hector here,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With us, one common shelter thou shalt find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or in one common fate with us be joined."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She said, and with a last salute embraced<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The poor old man, and by the laurel placed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold! Polites, one of Priam's sons,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pursued by Pyrrhus, there for safety runs.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"The gods," said he, "requite thy brutal rage!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He cheered my sorrows, and, for sums of gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bloodless carcase of my Hector sold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pitied the woes a parent underwent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sent me back in safety from his tent."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This said, his feeble hand a javelin threw,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Just, and but barely, to the mark it held,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His right hand held his bloody faulchion bare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His left he twisted in his hoary hair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, with a speeding thrust, his heart he found; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lukewarm blood came rushing through the wound, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sanguine streams distained the sacred ground. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus Priam fell, and shared one common fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Troy in ashes, and his ruined state&mdash;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He, who the sceptre of all Asia swayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom monarchs like domestic slaves obeyed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the bleak shore now lies the abandoned king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A headless carcase, and a nameless thing.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then, not before, I felt my cruddled blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Congeal with fear, my hair with horror stood:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My father's image filled my pious mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest equal years might equal fortune find.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again I thought on my forsaken wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And trembled for my son's abandoned life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I looked about, but found myself alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deserted at my need! My friends were gone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some spent with toil, some with despair oppressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaped headlong from the heights; the flames consumed the rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus wandering in my way without a guide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The graceless Helen in the porch I spied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Vesta's temple; there she lurked alone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Muffled she sate, and, what she could, unknown:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, by the flames that cast their blaze around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That common bane of Greece and Troy I found.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Ilium burnt, she dreads the Trojan sword; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">More dreads the vengeance of her injured lord; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even by those gods, who refuged her, abhorred. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trembling with rage, the strumpet I regard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resolved to give her guilt the due reward.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Shall she triumphant sail before the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leave in flames unhappy Troy behind?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall she her kingdom and her friends review,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In state attended with a captive crew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While unrevenged the good old Priam falls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Grecian fires consume the Trojan walls?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this the Phrygian fields and Xanthian flood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were swelled with bodies, and were drunk with blood?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis true, a soldier can small honour gain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And boast no conquest, from a woman slain:<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Yet shall the fact not pass without applause,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of vengeance taken in so just a cause.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The punished crime shall set my soul at ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And murmuring manes of my friends appease."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus while I rave, a gleam of pleasing light <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spread o'er the place; and, shining heavenly bright, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">My mother stood revealed before my sight&mdash; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never so radiant did her eyes appear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not her own star confessed a light so clear&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great in her charms, as when on gods above<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She looks, and breathes herself into their love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She held my hand, the destined blow to break;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then from her rosy lips began to speak:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"My son! from whence this madness, this neglect<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of my commands, and those whom I protect?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why this unmanly rage? Recall to mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom you forsake, what pledges leave behind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look if your helpless father yet survive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or if Ascanius or Cre&uuml;sa live.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around your house the greedy Grecians err; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And these had perished in the nightly war, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But for my presence and protecting care. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not Helen's face, nor Paris, was in fault;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But by the gods was this destruction brought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now cast your eyes around, while I dissolve<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mists and films that mortal eyes involve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Purge from your sight the dross, and make you see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shape of each avenging deity.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enlightened thus, my just commands fulfil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor fear obedience to your mother's will.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where yon disordered heap of ruin lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stones rent from stones,&mdash;where clouds of dust arise,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid that smother, Neptune holds his place, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Below the wall's foundation drives his mace, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heaves the building from the solid base. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Look, where, in arms, imperial Juno stands <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full in the Sc&aelig;an gate, with loud commands, <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Urging on shore the tardy Grecian bands. <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">See! Pallas, of her snaky buckler proud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bestrides the tower, refulgent through the cloud:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See! Jove new courage to the foe supplies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And arms against the town the partial deities.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Haste hence, my son! this fruitless labour end: <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Haste, where your trembling spouse and sire attend: <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Haste! and a mother's care your passage shall befriend." <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">She said, and swiftly vanished from my sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Obscure in clouds, and gloomy shades of night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I looked, I listened; dreadful sounds I hear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the dire forms of hostile gods appear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Troy sunk in flames I saw, (nor could prevent,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Ilium from its old foundations rent&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rent like a mountain-ash, which dared the winds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stood the sturdy strokes of labouring hinds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About the roots the cruel axe resounds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stumps are pierced with oft-repeated wounds:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The war is felt on high; the nodding crown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now threats a fall, and throws the leafy honours down.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To their united force it yields, though late,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mourns with mortal groans the approaching fate:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The roots no more their upper load sustain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But down she falls, and spreads a ruin through the plain.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Descending thence, I 'scape through foes and fire:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The good Anchises&mdash;whom, by timely flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I purposed to secure on Ida's height&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Refused the journey, resolute to die,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">These weak old hands suffice to stop my breath;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At least the pitying foes will aid my death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To take my spoils, and leave my body bare:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As for my sepulchre, let heaven take care.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">This oft repeated, he stood fixed to die: <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Myself, my wife, my son, my family, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>

<span class="i2">Urged by despair, again I go to try<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fate of arms, resolved in fight to die.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What hope remains, but what my death must give?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Can I, without so dear a father, live?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The way to death is wide, the approaches near:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For soon relentless Pyrrhus will appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reeking with Priam's blood&mdash;the wretch who slew <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">I went; but sad Cre&uuml;sa stopped my way,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"If death be your design&mdash;at least," said she,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">While thus she fills the house with clamorous cries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our hearing is diverted by our eyes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, while I held my son, in the short space<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt our kisses and our last embrace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Strange to relate!) from young I&uuml;lus' head <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lambent flame arose, which gently spread <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around his brows, and on his temples fed. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amazed, with running water we prepare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To quench the sacred fire, and slake his hair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But old Anchises, versed in omens, reared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hands to heaven, and this request preferred:&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Scarce had he said, when, on our left, we hear<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then in a steaming stench of sulphur died.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The good old man with suppliant hands implored<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With Vulcan's rage the rising winds conspire,<br /></span>

    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
<span class="i0">We met: not one was wanting; only she<br /></span>

<span class="i0">What mad expressions did my tongue refuse?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">This was the fatal blow, that pained me more<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Stung with my loss, and raving with despair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Abandoning my now forgotten care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of counsel, comfort, and of hope, bereft,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My sire, my son, my country gods, I left.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In shining armour once again I sheath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My limbs, not feeling wounds, nor fearing death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then headlong to the burning walls I run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seek the danger I was forced to shun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I tread my former tracks, through night explore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each passage, every street I crossed before.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All things were full of horror and affright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dreadful even the silence of the night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then to my father's house I make repair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With some small glimpse of hope to find her there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Instead of her, the cruel Greeks I met:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The house was filled with foes, with flames beset.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Driven on the wings of winds, whole sheets of fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through air transported, to the roofs aspire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From thence to Priam's palace I resort,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And search the citadel, and desert court.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, unobserved, I pass by Juno's church:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A guard of Grecians had possessed the porch;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There Ph&oelig;nix and Ulysses watch the prey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thither all the wealth of Troy convey&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spoils which they from ransacked houses brought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And golden bowls from burning altars caught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tables of the gods, the purple vests,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The people's treasure, and the pomp of priests.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A rank of wretched youths, with pinioned hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And captive matrons, in long order stands.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then, with ungoverned madness, I proclaim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through all the silent streets, Cre&uuml;sa's name:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But a pale spectre, larger than the life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aghast, astonished, and struck dumb with fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I stood; like bristles rose my stiffened hair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then thus the ghost began to sooth my grief:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Nor tears, nor cries, can give the dead relief.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">There Fortune shall the Trojan line restore,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Fear not that I shall watch, with servile shame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The imperious looks of some proud Grecian dame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, stooping to the victor's lust, disgrace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My goddess mother, or my royal race.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now, farewell! the parent of the gods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Restrains my fleeting soul in her abodes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I trust our common issue to your care."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She said, and gliding passed unseen in air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I strove to speak: but horror tied my tongue; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thrice about her neck my arms I flung, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, thrice deceived, on vain embraces hung. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Light as an empty dream at break of day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or as a blast of wind, she rushed away.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
<span class="i2">Thus having passed the night in fruitless pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I to my longing friends return again&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amazed the augmented number to behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of men and matrons mixed, of young and old&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wretched exiled crew together brought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With arms appointed, and with treasure fraught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resolved, and willing, under my command,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To run all hazards both of sea and land.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Morn began, from Ida, to display<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her rosy cheeks; and Phosphor led the day:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the gates the Grecians took their post,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all pretence of late relief was lost.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I yield to Fate, unwillingly retire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, loaded, up the hill convey my sire.<br /></span>

<blockquote>
<p class="ii1 pmb2"><i>&AElig;neas proceeds in his relation: he gives an account of the fleet with
which he sailed, and the success of his first voyage to Thrace. From
thence he directs his course to Delos, and asks the oracle what place
the gods had appointed for his habitation? By a mistake of the
oracle's answer, he settles in Crete. His household gods give him
the true sense of the oracle, in a dream. He follows their advice,
and makes the best of his way for Italy. He is cast on several
shores, and meets with very surprising adventures, till at length he
lands on Sicily, where his father Anchises dies. This is the place
which he was sailing from, when the tempest rose, and threw him
upon the Carthaginian coast.</i></p>

<span class="i0">When heaven had overturned the Trojan state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Priam's throne, by too severe a fate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When ruined Troy became the Grecians' prey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Ilium's lofty towers in ashes lay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warned by celestial omens, we retreat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To seek in foreign lands a happier seat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Near old Antandros, and at Ida's foot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The timber of the sacred groves we cut,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And build our fleet&mdash;uncertain yet to find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What place the gods for our repose assigned.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Friends daily flock; and scarce the kindly spring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Began to clothe the ground, and birds to sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When old Anchises summoned all to sea:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crew my father and the Fates obey.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sighs and tears I leave my native shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And empty fields, where Ilium stood before.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My sire, my son, our less and greater gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All sail at once, and cleave the briny floods.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Against our coast appears a spacious land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which once the fierce Lycurgus did command,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Thracia the name&mdash;the people bold in war&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Vast are their fields, and tillage is their care,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hospitable realm while Fate was kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Troy in friendship and religion joined.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I land, with luckless omens; then adore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their gods, and draw a line along the shore:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I lay the deep foundations of a wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And &AElig;nos, named from me, the city call.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Dion&aelig;an Venus vows are paid, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the powers that rising labours aid; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bull on Jove's imperial altar laid. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not far, a rising hillock stood in view;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sharp myrtles, on the sides, and cornels grew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, while I went to crop the sylvan scenes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shade our altar with their leafy greens,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I pulled a plant&mdash;with horror I relate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A prodigy so strange, and full of fate&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rooted fibres rose; and, from the wound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Black bloody drops distilled upon the ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mute and amazed, my hair with terror stood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fear shrunk my sinews, and congealed my blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Manned once again, another plant I try:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That other gushed with the same sanguine die.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, fearing guilt for some offence unknown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With prayers and vows the Dryads I atone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all the sisters of the woods, and most<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The god of arms, who rules the Thracian coast&mdash;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
<span class="i0">That they, or he, these omens would avert,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Release our fears, and better signs impart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cleared, as I thought, and fully fixed at length<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To learn the cause, I tugged with all my strength:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I bent my knees against the ground: once more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The violated myrtle ran with gore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce dare I tell the sequel: from the womb<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wounded earth, and caverns of the tomb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A groan, as of a troubled ghost, renewed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My fright, and then these dreadful words ensued:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Why dost thou thus my buried body rend?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O! spare the corpse of thy unhappy friend!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spare to pollute thy pious hands with blood:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tears distil not from the wounded wood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But every drop this living tree contains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is kindred blood, and ran in Trojan veins.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O! fly from this inhospitable shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warned by my fate; for I am Polydore!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here loads of lances, in my blood embrued,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again shoot upward, by my blood renewed."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My faultering tongue and shivering limbs declare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My horror, and in bristles rose my hair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Troy with Grecian arms was closely pent, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Priam, fearful of the war's event, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">This hapless Polydore to Thracia sent: <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loaded with gold, he sent his darling, far <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">From noise and tumults, and destructive war, <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Committed to the faithless tyrant's care; <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, when he saw the power of Troy decline,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forsook the weaker with the strong to join&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broke every bond of nature and of truth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And murdered, for his wealth, the royal youth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O sacred hunger of pernicious gold!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What bands of faith can impious lucre hold?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, when my soul had shaken off her fears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I call my father, and the Trojan peers&mdash;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Relate the prodigies of heaven&mdash;require<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What he commands, and their advice desire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All vote to leave that execrable shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Polluted with the blood of Polydore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, ere we sail, his funeral rites prepare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, to his ghost, a tomb and altars rear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In mournful pomp the matrons walk the round, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With baleful cypress and blue fillets crowned, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With eyes dejected, and with hair unbound. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then bowls of tepid milk and blood we pour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thrice invoke the soul of Polydore.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now, when the raging storms no longer reign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But southern gales invite us to the main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We launch our vessels, with a prosperous wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leave the cities and the shores behind.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">An island in the &AElig;g&aelig;an main appears:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Neptune and watery Doris claim it theirs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It floated once, till Ph&oelig;bus fixed the sides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rooted earth, and now it braves the tides.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, borne by friendly winds, we come ashore, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With needful ease our weary limbs restore, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Sun's temple and his town adore. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Anius, the priest and king, with laurel crowned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hoary locks with purple fillets bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who saw my sire the Delian shore ascend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came forth with eager haste to meet his friend;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Invites him to his palace; and, in sign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of ancient love, their plighted hands they join.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then to the temple of the god I went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus, before the shrine, my vows present:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Give, O Thymbr&aelig;us! give a resting place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the sad reliques of the Trojan race;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A seat secure, a region of their own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lasting empire, and a happier town.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where shall we fix? where shall our labours end?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom shall we follow, and what fate attend?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let not my prayers a doubtful answer find;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in clear auguries unveil thy mind."<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce had I said: he shook the holy ground, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The laurels, and the lofty hills around; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the tripos rushed a bellowing sound. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prostrate we fell; confessed the present god,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who gave this answer from his dark abode:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Undaunted youths! go, seek that mother earth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From which your ancestors derive their birth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The soil that sent you forth, her ancient race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In her old bosom, shall again embrace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the wide world the &AElig;neian house shall reign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And children's children shall the crown sustain."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus Ph&oelig;bus did our future fates disclose:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mighty tumult, mixed with joy, arose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All are concerned to know what place the god<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Assigned, and where determined our abode.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My father, long revolving in his mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The race and lineage of the Trojan kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus answered their demands:&mdash;"Ye princes, hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your pleasing fortune, and dispel your fear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fruitful isle of Crete, well known to fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sacred of old to Jove's imperial name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the mid ocean lies, with large command,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on its plains a hundred cities stand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another Ida rises there, and we<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From thence derive our Trojan ancestry.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From thence, as 'tis divulged by certain fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the Rh&oelig;tean shores old Teucer came;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There fixed, and there the seat of empire chose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere Ilium and the Trojan towers arose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In humble vales they built their soft abodes, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till Cybele, the mother of the gods, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With tinkling cymbals charmed the Id&aelig;an woods. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">She secret rites and ceremonies taught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the yoke the savage lions brought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let us the land, which heaven appoints, explore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Appease the winds, and seek the Gnosian shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If Jove assists the passage of our fleet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The third propitious dawn discovers Crete."<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Thus having said, the sacrifices, laid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On smoking altars, to the gods he paid&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bull, to Neptune an oblation due,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another bull to bright Apollo, slew&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A milk-white ewe, the western winds to please,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one coal-black, to calm the stormy seas.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere this, a flying rumour had been spread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That fierce Idomeneus from Crete was fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Expelled and exiled; that the coast was free<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From foreign or domestic enemy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We leave the Delian ports, and put to sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Naxos, famed for vintage, make our way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then green Donysa pass; and sail in sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Paros' isle, with marble quarries white.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We pass the scattered isles of Cyclades,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, scarce distinguished, seem to stud the seas.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shouts of sailors double near the shores;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They stretch their canvas, and they ply their oars.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"All hands aloft! for Crete! for Crete!" they cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And swiftly through the foamy billows fly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full on the promised land at length we bore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With joy descending on the Cretan shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With eager haste a rising town I frame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which from the Trojan Pergamus I name:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The name itself was grateful:&mdash;I exhort<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To found their houses, and erect a fort.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our ships are hauled upon the yellow strand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The youth begin to till the laboured land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I myself new marriages promote,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give laws, and dwellings I divide by lot;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When rising vapours choke the wholesome air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blasts of noisome winds corrupt the year;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The trees devouring caterpillars burn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Parched was the grass, and blighted was the corn:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor 'scape the beasts; for Sirius, from on high, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With pestilential heat infects the sky: <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">My men&mdash;some fall, the rest in fevers fry. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Again my father bids me seek the shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sacred Delos, and the god implore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To learn what end of woes we might expect,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to what clime our weary course direct.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">'Twas night, when every creature, void of cares,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The common gift of balmy slumber shares;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The statues of my gods, (for such they seemed,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those gods whom I from flaming Troy redeemed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before me stood, majestically bright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full in the beams of Ph&oelig;be's entering light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then thus they spoke, and eased my troubled mind:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What from the Delian god thou goest to find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He tells thee here, and sends us to relate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those powers are we, companions of thy fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who from the burning town by thee were brought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy fortune followed, and thy safety wrought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through seas and lands as we thy steps attend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So shall our care thy glorious race befriend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An ample realm for thee thy fates ordain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A town, that o'er the conquered world shall reign.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou, mighty walls for mighty nations build;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor let thy weary mind to labours yield:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But change thy seat; for not the Delian god,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor we, have given thee Crete for our abode.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A land there is, Hesperia called of old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(The soil is fruitful, and the natives bold&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The &OElig;notrians held it once,) by later fame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now called Italia, from the leader's name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Iasius there and Dardanus were born;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From thence we came, and thither must return.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rise, and thy sire with these glad tidings greet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Search Italy; for Jove denies thee Crete."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Astonished at their voices and their sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Nor were they dreams, but visions of the night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw, I knew their faces, and descried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In perfect view, their hair with fillets tied,)<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
<span class="i0">I started from my couch; a clammy sweat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On all my limbs and shivering body sate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To heaven I lift my hands with pious haste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sacred incense in the flames I cast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus to the gods their perfect honours done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More cheerful to my good old sire I run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tell the pleasing news. In little space<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He found his error of the double race;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not, as before he deemed, derived from Crete;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more deluded by the doubtful seat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then said,&mdash;"O son, turmoiled in Trojan fate!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such things as these Cassandra did relate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This day revives within my mind, what she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Foretold of Troy renewed in Italy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Latian lands; but who could then have thought, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Phrygian gods to Latium should be brought? <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or who believed what mad Cassandra taught? <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now let us go, where Ph&oelig;bus leads the way."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said; and we with glad consent obey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forsake the seat, and, leaving few behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We spread our sails before the willing wind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now from the sight of land our galleys move,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With only seas around, and skies above;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When o'er our heads descends a burst of rain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And night with sable clouds involves the main;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ruffling winds the foamy billows raise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The scattered fleet is forced to several ways;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The face of heaven is ravished from our eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in redoubled peals the roaring thunder flies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cast from our course, we wander in the dark;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No stars to guide, no point of land to mark.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even Palinurus no distinction found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt the night and day; such darkness reigned around.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three starless nights the doubtful navy strays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without distinction, and three sunless days;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The fourth renews the light, and, from our shrouds,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The canvas falls; their oars the sailors ply;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The dire abode where the foul Harpies reign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forced by the winged warriors to repair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To their old homes, and leave their costly fare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Monsters more fierce offended heaven ne'er sent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From hell's abyss, for human punishment&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With virgin-faces, but with wombs obscene, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Foul paunches, and with ordure still unclean; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With claws for hands, and looks for ever lean. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">We landed at the port, and soon beheld<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fat herds of oxen graze the flowery field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wanton goats without a keeper strayed.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With weapons we the welcome prey invade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then call the gods for partners of our feast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Jove himself, the chief invited guest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We spread the tables on the greensward ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We feed with hunger, and the bowls go round;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When from the mountain-tops, with hideous cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clattering wings, the hungry Harpies fly:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They snatch the meat, defiling all they find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, parting, leave a loathsome stench behind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close by a hollow rock, again we sit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New dress the dinner, and the beds refit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secure from sight, beneath a pleasing shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where tufted trees a native arbour made.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again the holy fires on altars burn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And once again the ravenous birds return,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or from the dark recesses where they lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or from another quarter of the sky&mdash;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With filthy claws their odious meal repeat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mix their loathsome ordures with their<a id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> meat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I bid my friends for vengeance then prepare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with the hellish nation wage the war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They, as commanded, for the fight provide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the grass their glittering weapons hide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, when along the crooked shore we hear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their clattering wings, and saw the foes appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Misenus sounds a charge: we take the alarm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And our strong hands with swords and bucklers arm.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this new kind of combat, all employ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their utmost force, the monsters to destroy&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain:&mdash;the fated skin is proof to wounds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from their plumes the shining sword rebounds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length rebuffed, they leave their mangled prey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their stretched pinions to the skies display.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet one remained&mdash;the messenger of Fate, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">High on a craggy cliff Cel&aelig;no sate, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus her dismal errand did relate:&mdash; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What! not contented with our oxen slain, <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dare you with heaven an impious war maintain, <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drive the Harpies from their native reign? <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heed therefore what I say; and keep in mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What Jove decrees, what Ph&oelig;bus has designed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I, the Furies' queen, from both relate&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You seek the Italian shores, foredoomed by Fate:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Italian shores are granted you to find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a safe passage to the port assigned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But know, that, ere your promised walls you build,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My curses shall severely be fulfilled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fierce famine is your lot&mdash;for this misdeed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reduced to grind the plates on which you feed."<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
<span class="i0">She said, and to the neighbouring forest flew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our courage fails us, and our fears renew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hopeless to win by war, to prayers we fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the offended Harpies humbly call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And (whether gods or birds obscene they were)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our vows, for pardon and for peace, prefer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But old Anchises, offering sacrifice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lifting up to heaven his hands and eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adored the greater gods&mdash;"Avert," said he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"These omens! render vain this prophecy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the impending curse a pious people free."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus having said, he bids us put to sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We loose from shore our halsers, and obey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soon with swelling sails pursue our watery way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amidst our course, Zacynthian woods appear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And next by rocky Neritos we steer:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We fly from Ithaca's detested shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And curse the land which dire Ulysses bore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length Leucate's cloudy top appears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the Sun's temple, which the sailor fears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resolved to breathe a while from labour past, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our crooked anchors from the prow we cast, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And joyful to the little city haste. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, safe beyond our hopes, our vows we pay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Jove, the guide and patron of our way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The customs of our country we pursue,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Trojan games on Actian shores renew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our youth their naked limbs besmear with oil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And exercise the wrestlers' noble toil&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pleased to have sailed so long before the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left so many Grecian towns behind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sun had now fulfilled his annual course,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Boreas on the seas displayed his force:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I fixed upon the temple's lofty door<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The brazen shield which vanquished Abas bore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The verse beneath my name and action speaks:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"These arms &AElig;neas took from conquering Greeks."<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then I command to weigh; the seamen ply<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their sweeping oars; the smoking billows fly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sight of high Ph&aelig;acia soon we lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And skimmed along Epirus' rocky coast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then to Chaonia's port our course we bend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, landed, to Buthrotus' heights ascend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here wondrous things were loudly blazed by Fame&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How Helenus revived the Trojan name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And reigned in Greece; that Priam's captive son<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Succeeded Pyrrhus in his bed and throne;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fair Andromache, restored by Fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more was happy in a Trojan mate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I leave my galleys riding in the port,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And long to see the new Dardanian court.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By chance, the mournful queen, before the gate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then solemnized her former husband's fate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Green altars, raised of turf, with gifts she crowned, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sacred priests in order stand around, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thrice the name of hapless Hector sound. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The grove itself resembles Ida's wood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Simo&iuml;s seemed the well-dissembled flood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when, at nearer distance, she beheld<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My shining armour and my Trojan shield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Astonished at the sight, the vital heat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forsakes her limbs, her veins no longer beat:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She faints, she falls, and scarce recovering strength,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus, with a faultering tongue, she speaks at length:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Are you alive, O goddess-born?" she said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Or if a ghost, then where is Hector's shade?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At this she cast a loud and frightful cry.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With broken words I made this brief reply:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"All of me, that remains, appears in sight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I live, if living be to loath the light&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No phantom; but I drag a wretched life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My fate resembling that of Hector's wife.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What have you suffered since you lost your lord?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By what strange blessing are you now restored?<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Still are you Hector's? or is Hector fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his remembrance lost in Pyrrhus' bed?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With eyes dejected, in a lowly tone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After a modest pause, she thus begun:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Oh only happy maid of Priam's race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom death delivered from the foe's embrace!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Commanded on Achilles' tomb to die, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not forced, like us, to hard captivity, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or in a haughty master's arms to lie. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Grecian ships, unhappy we were borne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Endured the victor's lust, sustained the scorn:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus I submitted to the lawless pride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Pyrrhus, more a handmaid than a bride.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cloyed with possession, he forsook my bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Helen's lovely daughter sought to wed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then me to Trojan Helenus resigned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his two slaves in equal marriage joined;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till young Orestes, pierced with deep despair, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And longing to redeem the promised fair, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before Apollo's altar slew the ravisher. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Pyrrhus' death the kingdom we regained:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At least one half with Helenus remained.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our part, from Chaon, he Chaonia calls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And names, from Pergamus, his rising walls.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But you what fates have landed on our coast?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What gods have sent you, or what storms have tossed?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does young Ascanius life and health enjoy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saved from the ruins of unhappy Troy?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O! tell me how his mother's loss he bears, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">What hopes are promised from his blooming years, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">How much of Hector in his face appears?"&mdash; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">She spoke; and mixed her speech with mournful cries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fruitless tears came trickling from her eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length her lord descends upon the plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In pomp, attended with a numerous train;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Receives his friends, and to the city leads,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tears of joy amidst his welcome sheds.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Proceeding on, another Troy I see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, in less compass, Troy's epitome.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A rivulet by the name of Xanthus ran,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I embrace the Sc&aelig;an gate again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My friends in porticoes were entertained,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And feasts and pleasures through the city reigned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tables filled the spacious hall around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And golden bowls with sparkling wine were crowned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two days we passed in mirth, till friendly gales,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blown from the south, supplied our swelling sails.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then to the royal seer I thus began:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O thou, who know'st, beyond the reach of man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The laws of heaven, and what the stars decree, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom Ph&oelig;bus taught unerring prophecy, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">From his own tripod, and his holy tree; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Skilled in the winged inhabitants of air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What auspices their notes and flights declare&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O! say; for all religious rites portend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A happy voyage, and a prosperous end;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every power and omen of the sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Direct my course for destined Italy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But only dire Cel&aelig;no, from the gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dismal famine fatally forebodes&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O! say, what dangers I am first to shun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What toils to vanquish, and what course to run."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The prophet first with sacrifice adores<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The greater gods; their pardon then implores;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unbinds the fillet from his holy head; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Ph&oelig;bus, next, my trembling steps he led, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full of religious doubts and awful dread. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, with his god possessed, before the shrine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These words proceeded from his mouth divine:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O goddess-born! (for heaven's appointed will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With greater auspices of good than ill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Foreshows thy voyage, and thy course directs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy fates conspire, and Jove himself protects,)<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And how at length the promised shore to gain. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rest the Fates from Helenus conceal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Juno's angry power forbids to tell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First, then, that happy shore, that seems so nigh, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will far from your deluded wishes fly; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long tracts of seas divide your hopes from Italy: <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For you must cruize along Sicilian shores,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stem the currents with your struggling oars;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then round the Italian coast your navy steer;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, after this, to Circe's island veer;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, last, before your new foundations rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must pass the Stygian lake, and view the nether skies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now mark the signs of future ease and rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bear them safely treasured in thy breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, in the shady shelter of a wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And near the margin of a gentle flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou shalt behold a sow upon the ground,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Nor let the threatened famine fright thy mind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Ph&oelig;bus will assist, and Fate the way will find.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let not thy course to that ill coast be bent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which fronts from far the Epirian continent:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those parts are all by Grecian foes possessed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The savage Locrians here the shores infest:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There fierce Idomeneus his city builds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And guards with arms the Salentinian fields;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the mountain's brow Petilia stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which Philoctetes with his troops commands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even when thy fleet is landed on the shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And priests with holy vows the gods adore,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Tack to the larboard, and stand off to sea:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Veer starboard sea and land. The Italian shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fair Sicilia's coast, were one, before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An earthquake caused the flaw: the roaring tides  <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The passage broke, that land from land divides; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, where the lands retired, the rushing ocean rides. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Distinguished by the straights, on either hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now rising cities in long order stand,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then spouts them from below: with fury driven,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The waves mount up, and wash the face of heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Scylla from her den, with open jaws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sinking vessel in her eddy draws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then dashes on the rocks.&mdash;A human face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And virgin bosom, hides her tail's disgrace:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her parts obscene below the waves descend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With dogs inclosed, and in a dolphin end.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis safer, then, to bear aloof to sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And coast Pachynus, though with more delay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than once to view mis-shapen Scylla near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the loud yell of watery wolves to hear.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">"Besides, if faith to Helenus be due,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if prophetic Ph&oelig;bus tell me true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do not this precept of your friend forget,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which therefore more than once I must repeat:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Arrived at Cum&aelig;, when you view the flood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of black Avernus, and the sounding wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mad prophetic Sibyl you shall find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dark in a cave, and on a rock reclined.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She sings the fates, and, in her frantic fits,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The notes and names, inscribed, to leaves commits.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What she commits to leaves, in order laid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the cavern's entrance are displayed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unmoved they lie; but, if a blast of wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without, or vapours issue from behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The leaves are borne aloft in liquid air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she resumes no more her museful care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor gathers from the rocks her scattered verse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor sets in order what the winds disperse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus, many not succeeding, most upbraid <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The madness of the visionary maid, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">This is what heaven allows me to relate; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now part in peace; pursue thy better fate, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And raise, by strength of arms, the Trojan state." <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">This when the priest with friendly voice declared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He gave me licence, and rich gifts prepared:<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Bounteous of treasure, he supplied my want<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With heavy gold, and polished elephant,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Dodon&aelig;an cauldrons put on board,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every ship with sums of silver stored.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A trusty coat of mail to me he sent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrice chained with gold, for use and ornament;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The helm of Pyrrhus added to the rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That flourished with a plume and waving crest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor was my sire forgotten, nor my friends;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And large recruits he to my navy sends&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Men, horses, captains, arms, and warlike stores;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Supplies new pilots, and new sweeping oars.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime, my sire commands to hoist our sails,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest we should lose the first auspicious gales.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The prophet blessed the parting crew, and, last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With words like these, his ancient friend embraced:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Old happy man, the care of gods above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom heavenly Venus honoured with her love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And twice preserved thy life when Troy was lost!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold from far the wished Ausonian coast:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There land; but take a larger compass round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For that before is all forbidden ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shore that Ph&oelig;bus has designed for you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At farther distance lies, concealed from view.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go happy hence, and seek your new abodes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blessed in a son, and favoured by the gods:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I with useless words prolong your stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When southern gales have summoned you away."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor less the queen our parting thence deplored,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor was less bounteous than her Trojan lord.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A noble present to my son she brought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A robe with flowers on golden tissue wrought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Phrygian vest; and loads with gifts beside<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of precious texture, and of Asian pride.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Accept," she said, "these monuments of love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which in my youth with happier hands I wove:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Regard these trifles for the giver's sake;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis the last present Hector's wife can make.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Thou call'st my lost Astyanax to mind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In thee, his features and his form I find.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His eyes so sparkled with a lively flame; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such were his motions; such was all his frame; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ah! had heaven so pleased, his years had been the same." <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">With tears I took my last adieu, and said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Your fortune, happy pair, already made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaves you no farther wish. My different state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Avoiding one, incurs another fate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To you a quiet seat the gods allow:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You have no shores to search, no seas to plough,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor fields of flying Italy to chase&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deluding visions, and a vain embrace!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You see another Simo&iuml;s, and enjoy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The labour of your hands, another Troy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With better auspice than her ancient towers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And less obnoxious to the Grecian powers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If e'er the gods, whom I with vows adore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conduct my steps to Tyber's happy shore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If ever I ascend the Latian throne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And build a city I may call my own;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As both of us our birth from Troy derive, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">So let our kindred lines in concord live, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And both in acts of equal friendship strive. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our fortunes, good or bad, shall be the same:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The double Troy shall differ but in name;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That what we now begin, may never end,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But long to late posterity descend."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Near the Ceraunian rocks our course we bore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shortest passage to the Italian shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now had the sun withdrawn his radiant light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hills were hid in dusky shades of night:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We land, and, on the bosom of the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A safe retreat and a bare lodging found.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close by the shore we lay; the sailors keep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their watches, and the rest securely sleep.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The night, proceeding on with silent pace, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood in her noon, and viewed with equal face <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her steepy rise, and her declining race. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then wakeful Palinurus rose, to spy <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The face of heaven, and the nocturnal sky; <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And listened, every breath of air to try; <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Observes the stars, and notes their sliding course,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Pleiads, Hyads, and their watery force;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And both the Bears is careful to behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bright Orion, armed with burnished gold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, when he saw no threatening tempest nigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a sure promise of a settled sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He gave the sign to weigh: we break our sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forsake the pleasing shore, and plough the deep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now the rising morn with rosy light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adorns the skies, and puts the stars to flight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When we from far, like bluish mists, descry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hills, and then the plains, of Italy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Achates first pronounced the joyful sound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then "Italy!" the cheerful crew rebound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My sire Anchises crowned a cup with wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, offering, thus implored the powers divine:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Ye gods, presiding over lands and seas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you who raging winds and waves appease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breathe on our swelling sails a prosperous wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smooth our passage to the port assigned!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gentle gales their flagging force renew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now the happy harbour is in view.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Minerva's temple then salutes our sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Placed, as a landmark, on the mountain's height.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We furl our sails, and turn the prows to shore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The curling waters round the galleys roar.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The land lies open to the raging east,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, bending like a bow, with rocks compressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shuts out the storms; the winds and waves complain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And vent their malice on the cliffs in vain.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The port lies hid within; on either side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two towering rocks the narrow mouth divide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The temple, which aloft we viewed before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To distance flies, and seems to shun the shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce landed, the first omens I beheld<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were four white steeds that cropped the flowery field.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"War, war is threatened from this foreign ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(My father cried,) where warlike steeds are found.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet since reclaimed, to chariots they submit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bend to stubborn yokes, and champ the bit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peace may succeed to war."&mdash;Our way we bend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Pallas, and the sacred hill ascend;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There prostrate to the fierce virago pray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose temple was the landmark of our way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each with a Phrygian mantle veiled his head, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all commands of Helenus obeyed, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pious rites to Grecian Juno paid. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">These dues performed, we stretch our sails, and stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sea, forsaking that suspected land.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From hence Tarentum's bay appears in view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Hercules renowned, if fame be true.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just opposite, Lacinian Juno stands;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Caulonian towers, and Scylac&aelig;an strands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For shipwrecks feared. Mount &AElig;tna thence we spy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Known by the smoky flames which cloud the sky.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far off we hear the waves with surly sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Invade the rocks, the rocks their groans rebound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The billows break upon the sounding strand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And roll the rising tide, impure with sand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then thus Anchises, in experience old:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"'Tis that Charybdis which the seer foretold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And those the promised rocks! Bear off to sea!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With haste the frighted mariners obey.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First Palinurus to the larboard veered;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then all the fleet by his example steered.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To heaven aloft on ridgy waves we ride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then down to hell descend, when they divide;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And thrice our galleys knocked the stony ground, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thrice the hollow rocks returned the sound, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thrice we saw the stars, that stood with dews around. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flagging winds forsook us, with the sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, wearied, on Cyclopian shores we run.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The port capacious, and secure from wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is to the foot of thundering &AElig;tna joined.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By turns a pitchy cloud she rolls on high; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">By turns hot embers from her entrails fly, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And flakes of mounting flames, that lick the sky. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft from her bowels massy rocks are thrown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, shivered by the force, come piece-meal down.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft liquid lakes of burning sulphur flow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fed from the fiery springs that boil below.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enceladus, they say, transfixed by Jove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With blasted limbs came tumbling from above;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, where he fell, the avenging father drew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This flaming hill, and on his body threw.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As often as he turns his weary sides,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He shakes the solid isle, and smoke the heavens hides.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In shady woods we pass the tedious night, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where bellowing sounds and groans our souls affright, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of which no cause is offered to the sight. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For not one star was kindled in the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor could the moon her borrowed light supply;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For misty clouds involved the firmament,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stars were muffled, and the moon was pent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce had the rising sun the day revealed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce had his heat the pearly dews dispelled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When from the woods there bolts, before our sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Somewhat betwixt a mortal and a sprite,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So thin, so ghastly meagre, and so wan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So bare of flesh, he scarce resembled man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This thing, all tattered, seemed from far to implore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our pious aid, and pointed to the shore.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
<span class="i0">We look behind, then view his shaggy beard;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His clothes were tagged with thorns, and filth his limbs besmeared;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rest, in mien, in habit, and in face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Appeared a Greek, and such indeed he was.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He cast on us, from far, a frightful view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom soon for Trojans and for foes he knew&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood still, and paused; then all at once began<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To stretch his limbs, and trembled as he ran.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon as approached, upon his knees he falls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus with tears and sighs for pity calls:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Now, by the powers above, and what we share<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Nature's common gift, this vital air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Trojans, take me hence! I beg no more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But bear me far from this unhappy shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis true, I am a Greek, and farther own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among your foes besieged the imperial town.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For such demerits if my death be due,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No more for this abandoned life I sue:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This only favour let my tears obtain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To throw me headlong in the rapid main:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since nothing more than death my crime demands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I die content, to die by human hands."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said, and on his knees my knees embraced:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I bade him boldly tell his fortune past,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His present state, his lineage, and his name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The occasion of his fears, and whence he came.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The good Anchises raised him with his hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who thus, encouraged, answered our demand:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"From Ithaca, my native soil, I came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Troy; and Ach&aelig;menides my name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Me my poor father with Ulysses sent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(O! had I stayed, with poverty content!)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, fearful for themselves, my countrymen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Left me forsaken in the Cyclops' den.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cave, though large, was dark; the dismal floor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was paved with mangled limbs and putrid gore.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Our monstrous host, of more than human size,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Erects his head, and stares within the skies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bellowing his voice, and horrid is his hue.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye gods, remove this plague from mortal view!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The joints of slaughtered wretches are his food;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for his wine he quaffs the streaming blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These eyes beheld, when with his spacious hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He seized two captives of our Grecian band;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stretched on his back, he dashed against the stones<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their broken bodies, and their crackling bones:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With spouting blood the purple pavement swims,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the dire glutton grinds the trembling limbs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not unrevenged Ulysses bore their fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor thoughtless of his own unhappy state;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, gorged with flesh, and drunk with human wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While fast asleep the giant lay supine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Snoaring aloud, and belching from his maw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His indigested foam, and morsels raw&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We pray; we cast the lots, and then surround<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The monstrous body, stretched along the ground:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each, as he could approach him, lends a hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bore his eye-ball with a flaming brand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath his frowning forehead lay his eye;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For only one did the vast frame supply&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that a globe so large, his front it filled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like the sun's disk, or like a Grecian shield.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stroke succeeds; and down the pupil bends;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This vengeance followed for our slaughtered friends.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But haste, unhappy wretches! haste to fly!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your cables cut, and on your oars rely!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such, and so vast as Polypheme appears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hundred more this hated island bears:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like him, in caves they shut their woolly sheep; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like him, their herds on tops of mountains keep; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like him, with mighty strides, they stalk from steep to steep. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And now three moons their sharpened horns renew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since thus in woods and wilds, obscure from view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I drag my loathsome days with mortal fright,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in deserted caverns lodge by night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft from the rocks a dreadful prospect see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the huge Cyclops, like a walking tree:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From far I hear his thundering voice resound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And trampling feet that shake the solid ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cornels and savage berries of the wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And roots and herbs, have been my meagre food.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While all around my longing eyes I cast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw your happy ships appear at last.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On those I fixed my hopes, to these I run;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis all I ask, this cruel race to shun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What other death you please, yourselves bestow."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce had he said, when on the mountain's brow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We saw the giant shepherd stalk before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His following flock, and leading to the shore&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A monstrous bulk, deformed, deprived of sight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His staff a trunk of pine, to guide his steps aright.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His ponderous whistle from his neck descends; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His woolly care their pensive lord attends: <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">This only solace his hard fortune sends. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon as he reached the shore, and touched the waves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From his bored eye the guttering blood he laves:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He gnashed his teeth, and groaned; through seas he strides,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And scarce the topmost billows touched his sides.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seized with a sudden fear, we run to sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cables cut, and silent haste away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The well-deserving stranger entertain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, buckling to the work, our oars divide the main.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The giant hearkened to the dashing sound:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, when our vessels out of reach he found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He strided onward, and in vain essayed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Ionian deep, and durst no farther wade.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With that he roared aloud: the dreadful cry <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shakes earth, and air, and seas; the billows fly, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the bellowing noise, to distant Italy. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The neighbouring &AElig;tna trembling all around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The winding caverns echo to the sound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His brother Cyclops hear the yelling roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, rushing down the mountains, crowd the shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We saw their stern distorted looks, from far,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one-eyed glance, that vainly threatened war&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A dreadful council! with their heads on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(The misty clouds about their foreheads fly,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not yielding to the towering tree of Jove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or tallest cypress of Diana's grove.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New pangs of mortal fear our minds assail; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">We tug at every oar, and hoist up every sail, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And take the advantage of the friendly gale. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forewarned by Helenus, we strive to shun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Charybdis' gulf, nor dare to Scylla run.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An equal fate on either side appears:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We, tacking to the left, are free from fears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, from Pelorus' point, the North arose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drove us back where swift Pantagias flows.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His rocky mouth we pass; and make our way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Thapsus, and Megara's winding bay.<br /></span>

<p class="pmb3">Virgil translated this verse from Homer, Homer had it from
Orpheus, and Orpheus from an ancient oracle of Apollo. On
this account it is that Virgil immediately subjoins these words,
<i>H&aelig;c Ph&oelig;bus</i>, &amp;c. Eustathius takes notice, that the old poets
were wont to take whole paragraphs from one another; which justifies
our poet for what he borrows from Homer. Bochartus, in
his letter to S&eacute;grais, mentions an oracle which he found in the
fragments of an old Greek historian, the sense whereof is this in
English, that, when the empire of the Priamid&aelig; should be destroyed,
the line of Anchises should succeed. Venus therefore, says
the historian, was desirous to have a son by Anchises, though he
was then in his decrepit age; accordingly she had &AElig;neas. After
this, she sought occasion to ruin the race of Priam, and set on foot
the intrigue of Alexander (or Paris) with Helena. She being ravished,
Venus pretended still to favour the Trojans, lest they should
restore Helen, in case they should be reduced to the last necessity.
Whence it appears, that the controversy betwixt Juno and Venus
was on no trivial account, but concerned the succession to a great
empire.</p>

<p class="center font09 pmb1">ARGUMENT.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="ii1 pmb2"><i>Dido discovers to her sister her passion for &AElig;neas, and her thoughts
of marrying him. She prepares a hunting-match for his entertainment.
Juno, by Venus's consent, raises a storm, which separates
the hunters, and drives &AElig;neas and Dido into the same
cave, where their marriage is supposed to be completed. Jupiter
dispatches Mercury to &AElig;neas, to warn him from Carthage.
&AElig;neas secretly prepares for his voyage. Dido finds out his
design, and, to put a stop to it, makes use of her own and her
sister's entreaties, and discovers all the variety of passions that
are incident to a neglected lover. When nothing would prevail
upon him, she contrives her own death, with which this book concludes.</i></p>

<span class="i0">Too like the sparkles of my former flame.<span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But first let yawning earth a passage rend,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Think you these tears, this pompous train of woe,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I grant, that, while your sorrows yet were green,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Preferring Juno's power, (for Juno ties<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nuptial knot, and makes the marriage-joys,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beauteous queen before her altar stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And holds the golden goblet in her hands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A milk-white heifer she with flowers adorns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pours the ruddy wine betwixt her horns;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, while the priests with prayer the gods invoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She feeds their altars with Sab&aelig;an smoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With hourly care the sacrifice renews,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And anxiously the panting entrails views.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What priestly rites, alas! what pious art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What vows, avail to cure a bleeding heart?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A gentle fire she feeds within her veins,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the soft god secure in silence reigns.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sick with desire, and seeking him she loves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From street to street the raving Dido roves.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, when the watchful shepherd, from the blind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wounds with a random shaft the careless hind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Distracted with her pain she flies the woods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bounds o'er the lawn, and seeks the silent floods&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fruitless care; for still the fatal dart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sticks in her side, and rankles in her heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now she leads the Trojan chief along<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lofty walls, amidst the busy throng;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Displays her Tyrian wealth, and rising town,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which love, without his labour, makes his own.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This pomp she shows, to tempt her wandering guest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her faultering tongue forbids to speak the rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When day declines, and feasts renew the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still on his face she feeds her famished sight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She longs again to hear the prince relate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His own adventures, and the Trojan fate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He tells it o'er and o'er; but still in vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For still she begs to hear it once again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hearer on the speaker's mouth depends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus the tragic story never ends.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Then, when they part, when Ph&oelig;be's paler light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Withdraws, and falling stars to sleep invite,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Sits on the bed he pressed, and sighs alone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Absent, her absent hero sees and hears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or in her bosom young Ascanius bears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seeks the father's image in the child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If love by likeness might be so beguiled.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Meantime the rising towers are at a stand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No labours exercise the youthful band,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor use of arts, nor toils of arms they know;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mole is left unfinished to the foe;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mounds, the works, the walls, neglected lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Short of their promised height, that seemed to threat the sky.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But when imperial Juno, from above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saw Dido fettered in the chains of love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hot with the venom which her veins inflamed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by no sense of shame to be reclaimed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With soothing words to Venus she begun:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"High praises, endless honours, you have won,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mighty trophies, with your worthy son!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two gods a silly woman have undone!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor am I ignorant, you both suspect<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This rising city, which my hands erect:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But shall celestial discord never cease?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis better ended in a lasting peace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You stand possessed of all your soul desired;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Poor Dido with consuming love is fired.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">So Dido shall be yours, &AElig;neas mine&mdash;   <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">One common kingdom, one united line.   <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eliza shall a Dardan lord obey,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then Venus (who her hidden fraud descried,   <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which would the sceptre of the world misguide<span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Libyan shores) thus artfully replied:&mdash;   <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>

<span class="i2">The loud report through Libyan cities goes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fame, the great ill, from small beginnings grows&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">By day, from lofty towers her head she shews,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spreads through trembling crowds disastrous news;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Things done relates, not done she feigns, and mingles truth with lies.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When first possessed with this unwelcome news,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom did he not of men and gods accuse?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This prince, from ravished Garamantis born,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hundred temples did with spoils adorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Ammon's honour, his celestial sire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hundred altars fed with wakeful fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, through his vast dominions, priests ordained,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose watchful care these holy rites maintained.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gates and columns were with garlands crowned,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Mad with despair, impatient with desire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then on the sacred altars pouring wine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He thus with prayers implored his sire divine:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Great Jove, propitious to the Moorish race,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thy temples, and adore thy power divine<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thy boasted thunder, and thy thoughtless reign?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Do thy broad hands the forky lightnings lance?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thine are the bolts, or the blind work of chance?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wandering woman builds, within our state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little town, bought at an easy rate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She pays me homage; (and my grants allow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A narrow space of Libyan lands to plough)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, scorning me, by passion blindly led,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Admits a banished Trojan to her bed!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now this other Paris, with his train<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He takes the spoil, enjoys the princely dame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I, rejected I, adore an empty name!"<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
<span class="i2">His vows, in haughty terms, he thus preferred,</span>
<span class="i0">And held his altar's horns. The mighty Thunderer heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then cast his eyes on Carthage, where he found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lustful pair in lawless pleasure drowned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lost in their loves, insensible of shame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And both forgetful of their better fame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He calls Cyllenius, and the god attends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By whom this menacing command he sends:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Go, mount the western winds, and cleave the sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, with a swift descent, to Carthage fly:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There find the Trojan chief, who wastes his days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In slothful riot and inglorious ease,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Not so fair Venus hoped, when twice she won<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Hers was a hero, destined to command<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A martial race, and rule the Latian land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who should his ancient line from Teucer draw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the conquered world impose the law.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If glory cannot move a mind so mean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor future praise from fading pleasure wean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet why should he defraud his son of fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And grudge the Romans their immortal name?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What are his vain designs? what hopes he more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From his long lingering on a hostile shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Regardless to redeem his honour lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for his race to gain the Ausonian coast?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bid him with speed the Tyrian court forsake;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With this command the slumbering warrior wake."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hermes obeys; with golden pinions binds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His flying feet, and mounts the western winds:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, whether o'er the seas or earth he flies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With rapid force they bear him down the skies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But first he grasps within his awful hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mark of sovereign power, his magic wand;<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With this he draws the ghosts from hollow graves;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With this he drives them down the Stygian waves;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With this he seals in sleep the wakeful sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And eyes, though closed in death, restores to light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus armed, the god begins his airy race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drives the racking clouds along the liquid space;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now sees the top of Atlas, as he flies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose brawny back supports the starry skies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Atlas, whose head, with piny forests crowned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is beaten by the winds, with foggy vapours bound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Snows hide his shoulders; from beneath his chin<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The founts of rolling streams their race begin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A beard of ice on his large breast depends.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, poised upon his wings, the god descends:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, rested thus, he from the towering height<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Plunged downward with precipitated flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lights on the seas, and skims along the flood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As water-fowl, who seek their fishy food,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Less, and yet less, to distant prospect show;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By turns they dance aloft, and dive below:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like these, the steerage of his wings he plies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And near the surface of the water flies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till, having passed the seas, and crossed the sands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He closed his wings, and stooped on Libyan lands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where shepherds once were housed in homely sheds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now towers within the clouds advance their heads.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arriving there, he found the Trojan prince<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New ramparts raising for the town's defence.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A purple scarf, with gold embroidered o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Queen Dido's gift) about his waist he wore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sword, with glittering gems diversified,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ornament, not use, hung idly by his side.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then thus, with winged words, the god began,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resuming his own shape&mdash;"Degenerate man!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou woman's property! what mak'st thou here,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To whom the Ausonian sceptre, and the state<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Rome's imperial name, is owed by Fate."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So spoke the god; and, speaking, took his flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Involved in clouds, and vanished out of sight.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The pious prince was seized with sudden fear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mute was his tongue, and upright stood his hair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Revolving in his mind the stern command,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He longs to fly, and loaths the charming land.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What should he say? or how should he begin?<span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">What course, alas! remains to steer between<span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The offended lover and the powerful queen? <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">This way, and that, he turns his anxious mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all expedients tries, and none can find.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fixed on the deed, but doubtful of the means,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">After long thought, to this advice he leans:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three chiefs he calls, commands them to repair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fleet, and ship their men, with silent care:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some plausible pretence he bids them find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To colour what in secret he designed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself, meantime, the softest hours would chuse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the love-sick lady heard the news;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And move her tender mind, by slow degrees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To suffer what the sovereign power decrees:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jove will inspire him, when, and what to say.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They hear with pleasure, and with haste obey.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But soon the queen perceives the thin disguise:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(What arts can blind a jealous woman's eyes?)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was the first to find the secret fraud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the fatal news was blazed abroad.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When, from afar, their nightly god they hear,         <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And howl about the hills, and shake the wreathy spear.<span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length she finds the dear perfidious man;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Prevents his formed excuse, and thus began:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Base and ungrateful! could you hope to fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And undiscovered 'scape a lover's eye?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor could my kindness your compassion move,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I beg you by these tears too truly shed,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">If ever Dido, when you most were kind,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Some young &AElig;neas to supply your place,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Here paused the queen. Unmoved he holds his eyes,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the white offered milk converts to mud.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This dire presage, to her alone revealed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From all, and even her sister, she concealed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A marble temple stood within the grove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sacred to death, and to her murdered love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That honoured chapel she had hung around<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With snowy fleeces, and with garlands crowned:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft, when she visited this lonely dome,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strange voices issued from her husband's tomb:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She thought she heard him summon her away,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Hourly 'tis heard, when with a boding note<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The solitary screech-owl strains her throat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, on a chimney's top, or turret's height,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With songs obscene, disturbs the silence of the night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besides, old prophecies augment her fears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stern &AElig;neas in her dreams appears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disdainful as by day: she seems, alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wander in her sleep, through ways unknown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Guideless and dark; or, in a desert plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To seek her subjects, and to seek in vain&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like Pentheus, when, distracted with his fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw two suns, and double Thebes, appear;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The Furies guard the door, and intercept his flight. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now, sinking underneath a load of grief,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The time and means resolved within her breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She to her mournful sister thus addressed:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Dissembling hope, her cloudy front she clears,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">My lover I shall gain, or lose my love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nigh rising Atlas, next the falling sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long tracts of Ethiopian climates run:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">She watched the golden fruit. Her charms unbind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The chains of love, or fix them on the mind:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She stops the torrents, leaves the channel dry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Repels the stars, and backward bears the sky.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The yawning earth rebellows to her call,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pale ghosts ascend, and mountain ashes fall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Witness, ye gods, and thou my better part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How loth I am to try this impious art!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where I my ruin in his arms embraced.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All reliques of the wretch are doomed to fire;<br /></span>

    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Thus far she said, and farther speech forbears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mortal paleness in her face appears:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet the mistrustless Anna could not find       <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The secret funeral, in these rites designed;   <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor thought so dire a rage possessed her mind. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unknowing of a train concealed so well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She feared no worse than when Sich&aelig;us fell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore obeys. The fatal pile they rear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within the secret court, exposed in air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cloven holms and pines are heaped on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And garlands on the hollow spaces lie.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sad cypress, vervain, yew, compose the wreath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every baleful green denoting death.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The queen, determined to the fatal deed,         <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Culls hoary simples, found by Ph&oelig;be's light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With brazen sickles reaped at noon of night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then mixes baleful juices in the bowl,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Robbing the mother's love.&mdash;The destined queen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Observes, assisting at the rites obscene:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A leavened cake in her devoted hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She holds, and next the highest altar stands:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One tender foot was shod, her other bare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Girt was her gathered gown, and loose her hair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus dressed, she summoned, with her dying breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The heavens and planets conscious of her death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And every power, if any rules above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who minds, or who revenges, injured love.<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
<span class="i2">'Twas dead of night, when weary bodies close<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their eyes in balmy sleep, and soft repose:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The winds no longer whisper through the woods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor murmuring tides disturb the gentle floods.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stars in silent order moved around;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Peace, with downy wings, was brooding on the ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flocks and herds, and party-coloured fowl,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which haunt the woods, or swim the weedy pool,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stretched on the quiet earth, securely lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forgetting the past labours of the day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All else of nature's common gift partake:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Forsake an empire, and attend a foe?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself I refuged, and his train relieved&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis true&mdash;but am I sure to be received?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can gratitude in Trojan souls have place?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laomedon still lives in all his race!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, shall I seek alone the churlish crew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or with my fleet their flying sails pursue?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What force have I but those, whom scarce before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I drew reluctant from their native shore?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will they again embark at my desire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more sustain the seas, and quit their second Tyre?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rather with steel thy guilty breast invade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And take the fortune thou thyself hast made.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your pity, sister, first seduced my mind,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Not mourned the living, nor disturbed the dead."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These thoughts she brooded in her anxious breast.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On board, the Trojan found more easy rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resolved to sail, in sleep he passed the night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ordered all things for his early flight.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To whom once more the winged god appears;&nbsp;  <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His former youthful mien and shape he wears,  <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with this new alarm invades his ears:&mdash;   <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Sleep'st thou, O goddess-born? and canst thou drown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy needful cares, so near a hostile town,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Invite thy passage, and inspire thy sails?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She harbours in her heart a furious hate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou shalt find the dire effects too late;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Prevent her rage, while night obscures the skies,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thus Hermes in the dream; then took his flight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aloft in air unseen, and mixed with night.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Twice warned by the celestial messenger,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pious prince arose with hasty fear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then roused his drowsy train without delay:        <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Haste to your banks! your crooked anchors weigh,  <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spread your flying sails, and stand to sea!    <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A God commands: he stood before my sight,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Lead thou the way; protect thy Trojan bands,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He said; and, drawing forth his flaming sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His thundering arm divides the many-twisted cord.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An emulating zeal inspires his train:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They run; they snatch; they rush into the main.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With headlong haste they leave the desert shores,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And brush the liquid seas with labouring oars.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">She looked to seaward; but the sea was void,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And scarce in ken the sailing ships descried.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stung with despite, and furious with despair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She struck her trembling breast, and tore her hair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And shall the ungrateful traitor go, (she said,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My land forsaken, and my love betrayed?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">All powers invoked with Dido's dying breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Attend her curses, and avenge her death!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If so the Fates ordain, and Jove commands,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But fall, untimely, by some hostile hand,  <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lie unburied on the barren sand!       <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">These are my prayers, and this my dying will;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">This said, within her anxious mind she weighs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The means of cutting short her odious days.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then to Sich&aelig;us' nurse she briefly said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(For, when she left her country, her's was dead,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Go, Barce, call my sister. Let her care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The solemn rites of sacrifice prepare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sheep, and all the atoning offerings, bring;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sprinkling her body from the crystal spring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With living drops; then let her come, and thou<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sacred fillets bind thy hoary brow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus will I pay my vows to Stygian Jove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And end the cares of my disastrous love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then cast the Trojan image on the fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as that burns, my passion shall expire."<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The nurse moves onward with officious care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the speed her aged limbs can bear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But furious Dido, with dark thoughts involved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shook at the mighty mischief she resolved.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With livid spots distinguished was her face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Red were her rolling eyes, and discomposed her pace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ghastly she gazed, with pain she drew her breath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nature shivered at approaching death.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Then swiftly to the fatal place she passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mounts the funeral pile with furious haste;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unsheaths the sword the Trojan left behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Not for so dire an enterprize designed.)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when she viewed the garments loosely spread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which once he wore, and saw the conscious bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She paused, and, with a sigh, the robes embraced, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then on the couch her trembling body cast,        <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Repressed the ready tears, and spoke her last:&mdash;  <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Dear pledges of my love, while heaven so pleased,<br /></span>

    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
<span class="i0">My fatal course is finished; and I go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A glorious name, among the ghosts below.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lofty city by my hands is raised;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pygmalion punished, and my lord appeased.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What could my fortune have afforded more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had the false Trojan never touched my shore?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then kissed the couch; and "Must I die," she said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And unrevenged? 'tis doubly to be dead!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet even this death with pleasure I receive:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On any terms, 'tis better than to live.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These flames, from far, may the false Trojan view;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These boding omens his base flight pursue!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She said, and struck; deep entered in her side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The piercing steel, with reeking purple dyed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clogged in the wound the cruel weapon stands;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spouting blood came streaming on her hands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her sad attendants saw the deadly stroke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with loud cries the sounding palace shook.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Distracted, from the fatal sight they fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And through the town the dismal rumour spread.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First, from the frighted court the yell began;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Redoubled, thence from house to house it ran:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The groans of men, with shrieks, laments, and cries<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mixing women, mount the vaulted skies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not less the clamour, than if&mdash;ancient Tyre,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the new Carthage, set by foes on fire&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rolling ruin, with their loved abodes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Involved the blazing temples of their gods.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her sister hears; and, furious with despair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She beats her breast, and rends her yellow hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, calling on Eliza's name aloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Runs breathless to the place, and breaks the crowd.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Was all that pomp of woe for this prepared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These fires, this funeral pile, these altars reared?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was all this train of plots contrived, (said she,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All only to deceive unhappy me?<br /></span>
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Which is the worst? Didst thou in death pretend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To scorn thy sister, or delude thy friend?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy summoned sister, and thy friend, had come;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One sword had served us both, one common tomb:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was I to raise the pile, the powers invoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not to be present at the fatal stroke?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once thou hast destroyed thyself and me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy town, thy senate, and thy colony!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring water! bathe the wound; while I in death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay close my lips to hers, and catch the flying breath."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This said, she mounts the pile with eager haste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in her arms the gasping queen embraced;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her temples chafed; and her own garments tore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To staunch the streaming blood, and cleanse the gore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrice Dido tried to raise her drooping head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, fainting, thrice fell grovelling on the bed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrice oped her heavy eyes, and saw the light, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, having found it, sickened at the sight,   <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And closed her lids at last in endless night.  <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Juno, grieving that she should sustain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A death so lingering, and so full of pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sent Iris down, to free her from the strife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of labouring nature, and dissolve her life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, since she died, not doomed by heaven's decree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or her own crime, but human casualty,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rage of love, that plunged her in despair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Sisters had not cut the topmost hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which Proserpine and they can only know;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor made her sacred to the shades below.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Downward the various Goddess took her flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drew a thousand colours from the light;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then stood above the dying lover's head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said, "I thus devote thee to the dead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This offering to the infernal gods I bear."                <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus while she spoke, she cut the fatal hair:              <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The struggling soul was loosed, and life dissolved in air. <span class="ir1">}</span></span>

&AElig;NE&Iuml;S, BOOK IV.</h2>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">----<i>And "must I die," she said,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>"And unrevenged? 'tis doubly to be dead!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Yet even this death with pleasure I receive;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>On any terms, 'tis better than to live."</i>&mdash;P. 351.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is certainly the sense of Virgil, on which I have paraphrased,
to make it plain. His words are these:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">----<i>Moriemur inult&aelig;?</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Sed moriamur, ait; sic, sic juvat ire sub umbras.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="pmb1">Servius makes an interrogation at the word <i>sic</i>; thus, <i>sic? Sic juvat
ire sub umbras</i>; which Mr Cowley justly censures: but his own
judgment may perhaps be questioned; for he would retrench the
latter part of the verse, and leave it a hemistick,&mdash;<i>Sed moriamur,
ait</i>. That Virgil never intended to have left any hemistick, I have
proved already in the preface. That this verse was filled up by
him with these words, <i>sic, sic juvat ire sub umbras</i>, is very probable,
if we consider the weight of them; for this procedure of Dido
does not only contain that <i>dira execratio, qu&aelig; nullo expiatur carmine</i>,<a id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
(as Horace observes in his "Canidia,") but, besides that,
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
Virgil, who is full of allusions to history, under another name describes
the Decii devoting themselves to death this way, though in
a better cause, in order to the destruction of the enemy. The reader,
who will take the pains to consult Livy in his accurate description
of those Decii thus devoting themselves, will find a great
resemblance betwixt these two passages. And it is judiciously observed
upon that verse,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Nulla fides populis nec f&oelig;dera sunto</i>,<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>that Virgil uses, in the word <i>sunto</i>, a <i>verbum juris</i>, a form of speaking
on solemn and religious occasions. Livy does the like. Note
also, that Dido puts herself into the <i>habitus Gabinus</i>, which was
the girding herself round with one sleeve of her vest; which is also
according to the Roman pontifical, in this dreadful ceremony,
as Livy has observed; which is a farther confirmation of this conjecture.
So that, upon the whole matter, Dido only doubts whether
she should die before she had taken her revenge, which she
rather wished; but, considering that this devoting herself was the
most certain and infallible way of compassing her vengeance, she
thus exclaims:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">----<i>Sic, sic juvat ire sub umbras!</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Hauriat hunc oculis ignem crudelis ab alto</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Dardanus, et nostr&aelig; secum ferat omina mortis?</i><br /></span>
</div></div>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Those flames from far may the false Trojan view;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those boding omens his base flight pursue!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>which translation I take to be according to the sense of Virgil. I
should have added a note on that former verse,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Infelix Dido! nunc te</i> fata <i>impia tangunt</i>&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>which, in the edition of Heinsius, is thus printed, <i>nunc te</i> facta <i>impia
tangunt?</i> The word <i>facta</i>, instead of <i>fata</i>, is reasonably altered;
for Virgil says afterwards, she died not by fate, nor by any
deserved death, <i>nec fato, merit&acirc; nec morte, peribat, &amp;c.</i> When I
translated that passage, I doubted of the sense, and therefore
omitted that hemistick, <i>nunc te fata impia tangunt</i>. But Heinsius
is mistaken only in making an interrogation-point instead of a period.
The words <i>facta impia</i>, I suppose, are genuine; for she had
perjured herself in her second marriage, having firmly resolved, as
she told her sister in the beginning of this &AElig;neid, never to love
again, after the death of her first husband; and had confirmed this
resolution by a curse on herself, if she should alter it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Sed mihi vel tellus, optem, prius ima dehiscat, &amp;c.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ante, pudor, quam te violem, aut tua jura resolvam.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Ille meos, primus qui me sibi junxit, amores</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Abstulit: ille habeat secum, servetque sepulcro.</i><br /></span>

BOOK V.</h2>


<p class="center font10 pmb1">ARGUMENT.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="ii1 pmb2"><i>&AElig;neas, setting sail from Afric, is driven by a storm on the coast of
Sicily, where he is hospitably received by his friend Acestes, king of
part of the island, and born of Trojan parentage. He applies himself
to celebrate the memory of his father with divine honours, and
accordingly institutes funeral games, and appoints prizes for those
who should conquer in them. While the ceremonies were performing,
Juno sends Iris to persuade the Trojan women to burn the ships,
who, upon her instigation, set fire to them; which burned four, and
would have consumed the rest, had not Jupiter, by a miraculous
shower, extinguished it. Upon this, &AElig;neas, by the advice of one of
his generals, and a vision of his father, builds a city for the women,
old men, and others, who were either unfit for war, or weary of the
voyage, and sails for Italy. Venus procures of Neptune a safe voyage
for him and all his men, excepting only his pilot Palinurus, who was
unfortunately lost.</i><a id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<span class="i0">His gods and ours shall share your equal vows.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besides, if, nine days hence, the rosy morn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall with unclouded light the skies adorn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That day with solemn sports I mean to grace:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Light galleys on the seas shall run a watery race:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some shall in swiftness for the goal contend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And others try the twanging bow to bend:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The strong, with iron gauntlets armed, shall stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Opposed in combat on the yellow sand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let all be present at the games prepared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And joyful victors wait the just reward.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now assist the rites, with garlands crowned."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said, and first his brows with myrtle bound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Helymus, by his example led,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And old Acestes, each adorned his head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus young Ascanius, with a sprightly grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His temples tied, and all the Trojan race.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">&AElig;neas then advanced amidst the train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By thousands followed through the flowery plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To great Anchises' tomb; which when he found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He poured to Bacchus, on the hallowed ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two bowls of sparkling wine, of milk two more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And two (from offered bulls) of purple gore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With roses then the sepulchre he strow'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus his father's ghost bespoke aloud:&mdash;<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"Hail, O ye holy manes! hail again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Paternal ashes, now reviewed in vain!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gods permitted not, that you, with me,    <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should reach the promised shores of Italy,    <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or Tyber's flood, what flood soe'er it be."   <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce had he finished, when, with speckled pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A serpent from the tomb began to glide;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hugy bulk on seven high volumes rolled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blue was his breadth of back, but streaked with scaly gold:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus riding on his curls, he seemed to pass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A rolling fire along, and singe the grass.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More various colours through his body run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than Iris when her bow imbibes the sun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt the rising altars, and around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sacred monster shot along the ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With harmless play amidst the bowls he passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with his lolling tongue assayed the taste:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus fed with holy food, the wondrous guest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within the hollow tomb retired to rest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pious prince, surprised at what he viewed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The funeral honours with more zeal renewed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doubtful if this the place's genius were,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or guardian of his father's sepulchre.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Five sheep, according to the rites, he slew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As many swine, and steers of sable hue;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New generous wine he from the goblets poured,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And called his father's ghost, from hell restored.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glad attendants in long order come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Offering their gifts at great Anchises' tomb:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some add more oxen; some divide the spoil;      <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some place the chargers on the grassy soil;     <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some blow the fires, and offered entrails boil. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i4">Now came the day desired. The skies were bright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With rosy lustre of the rising light:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bordering people, roused by sounding fame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Trojan feasts and great Acestes' name,<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The crowded shore with acclamations fill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Part to behold, and part to prove their skill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And first the gifts in public view they place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Green laurel wreaths, and palm, the victors' grace:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within the circle, arms and tripods lie,          <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ingots of gold and silver heaped on high,         <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And vests embroidered, of the Tyrian dye.         <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The trumpet's clangor then the feast proclaims,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all prepare for their appointed games.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Four galleys first, which equal rowers bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Advancing, in the watery lists appear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The speedy Dolphin, that outstrips the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bore Mnestheus, author of the Memmian kind:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gyas the vast Chim&aelig;ra's bulk commands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which rising like a towering city stands:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three Trojans tug at every labouring oar;         <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three banks in three degrees the sailors bore;    <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath their sturdy strokes the billows roar.    <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sergestus, who began the Sergian race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the great Centaur took the leading place:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cloanthus on the sea-green Scylla stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From whom Cluentius draws his Trojan blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Far in the sea, against the foaming shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There stands a rock: the raging billows roar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above his head in storms; but, when 'tis clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uncurl their ridgy backs, and at his foot appear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In peace below the gentle waters run;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cormorants above lie basking in the sun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On this the hero fixed an oak in sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mark to guide the mariners aright.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bear with this, the seamen stretch their oars;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then round the rock they steer, and seek the former shores.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lots decide their place. Above the rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each leader shining in his Tyrian vest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The common crew, with wreaths of poplar boughs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their temples crown, and shade their sweaty brows;<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Besmeared with oil, their naked shoulders shine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All take their seats, and wait the sounding sign:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They gripe their oars; and every panting breast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is raised by turns with hope, by turns with fear depressed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The clangor of the trumpet gives the sign;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once they start, advancing in a line:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With shouts the sailors rend the starry skies;      <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lashed with their oars, the smoky billows rise;     <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sparkles the briny main, and the vexed ocean fries. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exact in time, with equal strokes they row:        <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">At once the brushing oars and brazen prow          <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dash up the sandy waves, and ope the depths below. <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not fiery coursers, in a chariot race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Invade the field with half so swift a pace:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not the fierce driver with more fury lends      <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sounding lash, and ere the stroke descends, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Low to the wheels his pliant body bends.        <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The partial crowd their hopes and fears divide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And aid, with eager shouts, the favoured side.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cries, murmurs, clamours, with a mixing sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From woods to woods, from hills to hills, rebound.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Amidst the loud applauses of the shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gyas outstripped the rest, and sprung before:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cloanthus, better manned, pursued him fast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But his o'er-masted galley checked his haste.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Centaur and the Dolphin brush the brine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With equal oars, advancing in a line;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now the mighty Centaur seems to lead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now the speedy Dolphin gets a-head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now board to board the rival vessels row,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The billows lave the skies, and ocean groans below.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They reached the mark. Proud Gyas and his train<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In triumph rode, the victors of the main;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, steering round, he charged his pilot stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More close to shore, and skim along the sand;&mdash;<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"Let others bear to sea!"&mdash;Men&oelig;tes heard;       <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But secret shelves too cautiously he feared,               <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, fearing, sought the deep; and still aloof he steered. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With louder cries the captain called again:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Bear to the rocky shore, and shun the main."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He spoke, and, speaking, at his stern he saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bold Cloanthus near the shelvings draw.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt the mark and him the Scylla stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in a closer compass ploughed the flood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He passed the mark; and, wheeling, got before:&mdash;  <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gyas blasphemed the gods, devoutly swore,         <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cried out for anger, and his hair he tore.        <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mindless of others' lives, (so high was grown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His rising rage,) and careless of his own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The trembling dotard to the deck he drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hoisted up, and overboard he threw:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This done, he seized the helm; his fellows cheered,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turned short upon the shelves, and madly steered.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Hardly his head the plunging pilot rears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clogged with his clothes, and cumbered with his years:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now dropping wet, he climbs the cliff with pain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crowd, that saw him fall and float again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shout from the distant shore; and loudly laught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see his heaving breast disgorge the briny draught.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The following Centaur, and the Dolphin's crew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their vanished hopes of victory renew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While Gyas lags, they kindle in the race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To reach the mark. Sergestus takes the place;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mnestheus pursues; and, while around they wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comes up, not half his galley's length behind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then on the deck, amidst his mates, appeared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus their drooping courages he cheered:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"My friends, and Hector's followers heretofore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exert your vigour; tug the labouring oar;<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Stretch to your strokes, my still unconquered crew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom from the flaming walls of Troy I drew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this our common interest, let me find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That strength of hand, that courage of the mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when you stemmed the strong Malean flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And o'er the Syrtes' broken billows rowed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I seek not now the foremost palm to gain;       <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though yet&mdash;but, ah! that haughty wish is vain! <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let those enjoy it whom the gods ordain.        <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But to be last, the lags of all the race!&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Redeem yourselves and me from that disgrace."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, one and all, they tug amain; they row<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the full stretch, and shake the brazen prow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sea beneath them sinks; their labouring sides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are swelled, and sweat runs guttering down in tides.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chance aids their daring with unhoped success:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sergestus, eager with his beak to press<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt the rival galley and the rock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shuts up the unwieldy Centaur in the lock.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vessel struck; and, with the dreadful shock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her oars she shivered, and her head she broke.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The trembling rowers from their banks arise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, anxious for themselves, renounce the prize.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With iron poles they heave her off the shores,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gather from the sea their floating oars.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crew of Mnestheus, with elated minds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Urge their success, and call the willing winds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then ply their oars, and cut their liquid way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In larger compass on the roomy sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As, when the dove her rocky hold forsakes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roused in a fright, her sounding wings she shakes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cavern rings with clattering; out she flies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leaves her callow care, and cleaves the skies:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At first she flutters; but at length she springs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To smoother flight, and shoots upon her wing:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Mnestheus in the Dolphin cuts the sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, flying with a force, that force assists his way.<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Sergestus in the Centaur soon he passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wedged in the rocky shoals, and sticking fast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain the victor he with cries implores,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And practises to row with shattered oars.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Mnestheus bears with Gyas, and outflies:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ship, without a pilot, yields the prize.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unvanquished Scylla now alone remains;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her he pursues, and all his vigour strains.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shouts from the favouring multitude arise;                     <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Applauding Echo to the shouts replies;                         <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shouts, wishes, and applause, run rattling through the skies.  <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">These clamours with disdain the Scylla heard,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Much grudged the praise, but more the robbed reward:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Resolved to hold their own, they mend their pace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All obstinate to die, or gain the race.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Raised with success, the Dolphin swiftly ran;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they can conquer, who believe they can.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both urge their oars, and Fortune both supplies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And both perhaps had shared an equal prize;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When to the seas Cloanthus holds his hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And succour from the watery powers demands:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Gods of the liquid realms, on which I row!   <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">If, given by you, the laurel bind my brow,    <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Assist to make me guilty of my vow!)         <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A snow-white bull shall on your shore be slain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His offered entrails cast into the main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ruddy wine from golden goblets thrown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your grateful gift and my return shall own."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The choir of nymphs, and Phorcus, from below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With virgin Panopea, heard his vow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And old Portunus, with his breadth of hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pushed on, and sped the galley to the land.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swift as a shaft, or winged wind, she flies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, darting to the port, obtains the prize.<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The herald summons all, and then proclaims<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cloanthus conqueror of the naval games.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The prince with laurel crowns the victor's head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And three fat steers are to his vessel led,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ship's reward; with generous wine beside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sums of silver, which the crew divide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The leaders are distinguished from the rest;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The victor honoured with a nobler vest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where gold and purple strive in equal rows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And needle-work its happy cost bestows.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, Ganymede is wrought with living art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chasing through Ida's groves the trembling hart:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breathless he seems, yet eager to pursue;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When from aloft descends, in open view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bird of Jove, and, sousing on his prey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With crooked talons bears the boy away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain, with lifted hands and gazing eyes,     <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His guards behold him soaring through the skies, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dogs pursue his flight with imitated cries.  <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i4">Mnestheus the second victor was declared;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, summoned there, the second prize he shared&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A coat of mail, which brave Demoleus bore,    <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">More brave &AElig;neas from his shoulders tore,     <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In single combat on the Trojan shore.         <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">This was ordained for Mnestheus to possess&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In war for his defence, for ornament in peace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rich was the gift, and glorious to behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But yet so ponderous with its plates of gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That scarce two servants could the weight sustain;  <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, loaded thus, Demoleus o'er the plain           <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pursued, and lightly seized, the Trojan train.      <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The third, succeeding to the last reward,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two goodly bowls of massy silver shared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With figures prominent, and richly wrought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And two brass cauldrons from Dodona brought.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Thus all, rewarded by the hero's hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their conquering temples bound with purple bands.<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And now Sergestus, clearing from the rock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought back his galley shattered with the shock.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forlorn she looked, without an aiding oar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, hooted by the vulgar, made to shore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when a snake, surprised upon the road,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is crushed athwart her body by the load<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of heavy wheels; or with a mortal wound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her belly bruised, and trodden to the ground&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain, with loosened curls, she crawls along;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, fierce above, she brandishes her tongue;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glares with her eyes, and bristles with her scales;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, grovelling in the dust, her parts unsound she trails.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So slowly to the port the Centaur tends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, what she wants in oars, with sails amends.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, for his galley saved, the grateful prince<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is pleased the unhappy chief to recompense.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pholoe, the Cretan slave, rewards his care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beauteous herself, with lovely twins as fair.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">From thence his way the Trojan hero bent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the neighbouring plain, with mountains pent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose sides were shaded with surrounding wood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full in the midst of this fair valley, stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A native theatre, which, rising slow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By just degrees, o'erlooked the ground below.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High on a sylvan throne the leader sate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A numerous train attend in solemn state.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here those, that in the rapid course delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Desire of honour, and the prize, invite.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rival runners without order stand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Trojans, mixed with the Sicilian band.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First Nisus, with Euryalus, appears&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Euryalus a boy of blooming years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sprightly grace and equal beauty crowned&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nisus, for friendship to the youth, renowned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Diores next, of Priam's royal race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Salius, joined with Patron, took their place;<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
<span class="i0">(But Patron in Arcadia had his birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Salius, his from Acarnanian earth;)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then two Sicilian youths&mdash;the names of these,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swift Helymus, and lovely Panopes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Both jolly huntsmen, both in forests bred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And owning old Acestes for their head,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With several others of ignobler name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom time has not delivered o'er to fame.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">To these the hero thus his thoughts explained,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In words which general approbation gained:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"One common largess is for all designed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(The vanquished and the victor shall be joined,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two darts of polished steel and Gnossian wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A silver-studded axe, alike bestowed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The foremost three have olive wreaths decreed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first of these obtains a stately steed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adorned with trappings; and the next in fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The quiver of an Amazonian dame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With feathered Thracian arrows well supplied:  <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A golden belt shall gird his manly side,       <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which with a sparkling diamond shall be tied.  <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The third this Grecian helmet shall content."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said. To their appointed base they went;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With beating hearts the expected sign receive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, starting all at once, the barrier leave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spread out, as on the winged winds, they flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seized the distant goal with greedy view.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shot from the crowd, swift Nisus all o'er-passed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor storms, nor thunder, equal half his haste.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The next, but, though the next, yet far disjoined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came Salius, and Euryalus behind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Helymus, whom young Diores plied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Step after step, and almost side by side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His shoulders pressing&mdash;and, in longer space,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had won, or left at least a dubious race.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Now, spent, the goal they almost reach at last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When eager Nisus, hapless in his haste,<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Slipped first, and, slipping, fell upon the plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soaked with the blood of oxen newly slain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The careless victor had not marked his way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, treading where the treacherous puddle lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His heels flew up; and on the grassy floor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He fell, besmeared with filth and holy gore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not mindless then, Euryalus, of thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor of the sacred bonds of amity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He strove the immediate rival's hope to cross,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And caught the foot of Salius as he rose:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So Salius lay extended on the plain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Euryalus springs out, the prize to gain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leaves the crowd:&mdash;applauding peals attend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The victor to the goal, who vanquished by his friend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Next Helymus; and then Diores came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By two misfortunes made the third in fame.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">But Salius enters, and, exclaiming loud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For justice, deafens and disturbs the crowd;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Urges his cause may in the court be heard;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pleads the prize is wrongfully conferred.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But favour for Euryalus appears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His blooming beauty, with his tender years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had bribed the judges for the promised prize;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besides, Diores fills the court with cries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who vainly reaches at the last reward,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If the first palm on Salius be conferred.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then thus the prince: "Let no disputes arise:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Fortune placed it, I award the prize.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Fortune's errors give me leave to mend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At least to pity my deserving friend"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said, and, from among the spoils, he draws<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Ponderous with shaggy mane and golden paws)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lion's hide: to Salius this he gives:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nisus with envy sees the gift, and grieves.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"If such rewards to vanquished men are due,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(He said) and falling is to rise by you,<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
<span class="i0">What prize may Nisus from your bounty claim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who merited the first rewards and fame?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In falling, both an equal fortune tried;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would Fortune for my fall so well provide!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With this he pointed to his face, and showed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hands and all his habit smeared with blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The indulgent father of the people smiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And caused to be produced an ample shield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wondrous art, by Didymaon wrought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long since from Neptune's bars in triumph brought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This given to Nisus, he divides the rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And equal justice in his gifts expressed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The race thus ended, and rewards bestowed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once more the prince bespeaks the attentive crowd:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"If there be here, whose dauntless courage dare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In gauntlet fight, with limbs and body bare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His opposite sustain in open view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stand forth the champion, and the games renew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two prizes I propose, and thus divide&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bull with gilded horns, and fillets tied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall be the portion of the conquering chief:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sword and helm shall cheer the loser's grief."<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Then haughty Dares in the lists appears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stalking he strides, his head erected bears:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His nervous arms the weighty gauntlet wield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And loud applauses echo through the field.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dares alone in combat used to stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The match of mighty Paris, hand to hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The same, at Hector's funerals, undertook<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gigantic Butes, of the Amycian stock,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, by the stroke of his resistless hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stretched the vast bulk upon the yellow sand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such Dares was; and such he strode along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drew the wonder of the gazing throng.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His brawny back and ample breast he shows;    <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His lifted arms around his head he throws,    <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And deals, in whistling air, his empty blows. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
<span class="i0">His match is sought: but, through the trembling band,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not one dares answer to the proud demand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Presuming of his force, with sparkling eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Already he devours the promised prize.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He claims the bull with awless insolence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, having seized his horns, accosts the prince:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"If none my matchless valour dares oppose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How long shall Dares wait his dastard foes?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Permit me, chief, permit, without delay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lead this uncontended gift away."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crowd assents, and, with redoubled cries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the proud challenger demands the prize.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Acestes, fired with just disdain, to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The palm usurped without a victory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reproached Entellus thus, who sate beside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heard and saw, unmoved, the Trojan's pride:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Once, but in vain, a champion of renown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So tamely can you bear the ravished crown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A prize in triumph borne before your sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shun, for fear, the danger of the fight?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where is our Eryx now, the boasted name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The god, who taught your thundering arm the game?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where now your baffled honour? where the spoil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That filled your house, and fame that filled our isle?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Entellus, thus:&mdash;"My soul is still the same,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unmoved with fear, and moved with martial fame;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But my chill blood is curdled in my veins,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And scarce the shadow of a man remains.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh! could I turn to that fair prime again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That prime, of which this boaster is so vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The brave, who this decrepit age defies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should feel my force, without the promised prize."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said; and, rising at the word, he threw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two ponderous gauntlets down in open view&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gauntlets, which Eryx wont in fight to wield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sheath his hands with, in the listed field.<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With fear and wonder seized, the crowd beholds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gloves of death, with seven distinguished folds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of tough bull-hides; the space within is spread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With iron, or with loads of heavy lead:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dares himself was daunted at the sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Renounced his challenge, and refused to fight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Astonished at their weight, the hero stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And poised the ponderous engines in his hands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What had your wonder (said Entellus) been,        <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had you the gauntlets of Alcides seen,             <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or viewed the stern debate on this unhappy green!  <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">These, which I bear, your brother Eryx bore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still marked with battered brains and mingled gore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With these he long sustained the Herculean arm;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And these I wielded while my blood was warm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This languished frame while better spirits fed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere age unstrung my nerves, or time o'ersnowed my head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, if the challenger these arms refuse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cannot wield their weight, or dare not use;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If great &AElig;neas and Acestes join<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In his request, these gauntlets I resign;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let us with equal arms perform the fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let him leave to fear, since I resign my right."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This said, Entellus for the strife prepares;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stripped of his quilted coat, his body bares;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Composed of mighty bones and brawn, he stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A goodly towering object on the sands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then just &AElig;neas equal arms supplied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which round their shoulders to their wrists they tied.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both on the tiptoe stand, at full extent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their arms aloft, their bodies inly bent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their heads from aiming blows they bear afar;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With clashing gauntlets then provoke the war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One on his youth and pliant limbs relies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One on his sinews, and his giant size.<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The last is stiff with age, his motion slow;          <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">He heaves for breath, he staggers to and fro,         <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And clouds of issuing smoke his nostrils loudly blow. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet equal in success, they ward, they strike;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their ways are different, but their art alike.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before, behind, the blows are dealt; around<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their hollow sides the rattling thumps resound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A storm of strokes, well meant, with fury flies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And errs about their temples, ears, and eyes&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor always errs; for oft the gauntlet draws<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sweeping stroke along the crackling jaws.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heavy with age, Entellus stands his ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But with his warping body wards the wound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hand and watchful eye keep even pace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While Dares traverses, and shifts his place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, like a captain who beleaguers round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some strong-built castle on a rising ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Views all the approaches with observing eyes;  <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">This and that other part in vain he tries,     <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And more on industry than force relies.        <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With hands on high, Entellus threats the foe;            <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Dares watched the motion from below,                 <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And slipped aside, and shunned the long-descending blow. <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Entellus wastes his forces on the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, thus deluded of the stroke designed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Headlong and heavy fell; his ample breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And weighty limbs, his ancient mother pressed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So falls a hollow pine, that long had stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Ida's height, or Erymanthus' wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Torn from the roots. The differing nations rise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shouts and mingled murmurs rend the skies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Acestes runs with eager haste, to raise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fallen companion of his youthful days.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dauntless he rose, and to the fight returned;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With shame his glowing cheeks, his eyes with fury burned.<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Disdain and conscious virtue fired his breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with redoubled force his foe he pressed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He lays on load with either hand, amain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And headlong drives the Trojan o'er the plain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor stops, nor stays; nor rest nor breath allows;  <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But storms of strokes descend about his brows,     <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A rattling tempest, and a hail of blows.           <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now the prince, who saw the wild increase       <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wounds, commands the combatants to cease,        <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bounds Entellus' wrath, and bids the peace.     <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">First to the Trojan, spent with toil, he came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soothed his sorrow for the suffered shame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What fury seized my friend? The Gods, (said he)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To him propitious, and averse to thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have given his arm superior force to thine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis madness to contend with strength divine."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gauntlet-fight thus ended, from the shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His faithful friends unhappy Dares bore:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His mouth and nostrils poured a purple flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pounded teeth came rushing with his blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Faintly he staggered through the hissing throng,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hung his head, and trailed his legs along.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sword and casque are carried by his train;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But with his foe the palm and ox remain.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The champion, then, before &AElig;neas came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proud of his prize, but prouder of his fame:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O goddess-born, and you, Dardanian host,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mark with attention, and forgive my boast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Learn what I was, by what remains; and know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From what impending fate you saved my foe."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sternly he spoke, and then confronts the bull;     <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, on his ample forehead aiming full,            <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The deadly stroke, descending, pierced the skull.  <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down drops the beast, nor needs a second wound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But sprawls in pangs of death, and spurns the ground.<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then, thus:&mdash;"In Dares's stead I offer this.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eryx! accept a nobler sacrifice:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take the last gift my withered arms can yield:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gauntlets I resign, and here renounce the field."<br /></span>
<span class="i4">This done, &AElig;neas orders, for the close,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The strife of archers, with contending bows.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mast, Sergestus' shattered galley bore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his own hands he raises on the shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fluttering dove upon the top they tie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The living mark at which their arrows fly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rival archers in a line advance,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their turn of shooting to receive from chance.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A helmet holds their names: the lots are drawn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the first scroll was read Hippocoon:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The people shout. Upon the next was found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Young Mnestheus, late with naval honours crowned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The third contained Eurytion's noble name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy brother, Pandarus, and next in fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom Pallas urged the treaty to confound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And send among the Greeks a feathered wound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Acestes, in the bottom, last remained,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom not his age from youthful sports restrained.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon all with vigour bend their trusty bows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the quiver each his arrow chose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hippocoon's was the first: with forceful sway<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It flew, and, whizzing, cut the liquid way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fixed in the mast the feathered weapon stands:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fearful pigeon flutters in her bands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the tree trembled, and the shouting cries<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the pleased people rend the vaulted skies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Mnestheus to the head his arrow drove,     <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">With lifted eyes, and took his aim above,       <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But made a glancing shot, and missed the dove;  <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet missed so narrow, that he cut the cord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which fastened, by the foot, the flitting bird.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The captive thus released, away she flies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And beats, with clapping wings, the yielding skies.<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
<span class="i0">His bow already bent, Eurytion stood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, having first invoked his brother god,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His winged shaft with eager haste he sped.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fatal message reached her as she fled:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She leaves her life aloft; she strikes the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And renders back the weapon in the wound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Acestes, grudging at his lot, remains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without a prize to gratify his pains.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, shooting upward, sends his shaft, to show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An archer's art, and boast his twanging bow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The feathered arrow gave a dire portent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And latter augurs judge from this event.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chafed by the speed, it fired; and, as it flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A trail of following flames, ascending drew:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kindling they mount, and mark the shiny way;  <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across the skies as falling meteors play,     <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And vanish into wind, or in a blaze decay.    <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Trojans and Sicilians wildly stare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, trembling, turn their wonder into prayer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Dardan prince put on a smiling face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strained Acestes with a close embrace;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then honouring him with gifts above the rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turned the bad omen, nor his fears confessed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The gods (said he) this miracle have wrought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ordered you the prize without the lot.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Accept this goblet, rough with figured gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which Thracian Cisseus gave my sire of old:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This pledge of ancient amity receive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which to my second sire I justly give."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said, and, with the trumpet's cheerful sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proclaimed him victor, and with laurel crowned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor good Eurytion envied him the prize,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though he transfixed the pigeon in the skies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who cut the line, with second gifts was graced;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The third was his, whose arrow pierced the mast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The chief, before the games were wholly done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Called Periphantes, tutor to his son,<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And whispered thus:&mdash;"With speed Ascanius find;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, if his childish troop be ready joined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On horseback let him grace his grandsire's day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lead his equals armed in just array."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said; and, calling out, the cirque he clears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crowd withdrawn, an open plain appears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now the noble youths, of form divine,                 <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Advance before their fathers, in a line:                  <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The riders grace the steeds; the steeds with glory shine. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i4">Thus marching on in military pride,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shouts of applause resound from side to side.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their casques adorned with laurel wreaths they wear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each brandishing aloft a cornel spear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some at their backs their gilded quivers bore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their chains of burnished gold hung down before.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three graceful troops they formed upon the green;      <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three graceful leaders at their head were seen;        <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twelve followed every chief, and left a space between. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first young Priam led&mdash;a lovely boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose grandsire was the unhappy king of Troy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(His race in after-times was known to fame,       <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">New honours adding to the Latian name,)           <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And well the royal boy his Thracian steed became. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">White were the fetlocks of his feet before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on his front a snowy star he bore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then beauteous Atys, with I&uuml;lus bred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of equal age, the second squadron led.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The last in order, but the first in place,<a id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">First in the lovely features of his face,<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Rode fair Ascanius on a fiery steed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Queen Dido's gift, and of the Tyrian breed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sure coursers for the rest the king ordains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With golden bits adorned, and purple reins.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pleased spectators peals of shouts renew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the parents in the children view;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their make, their motions, and their sprightly grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hopes and fears alternate in their face.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The unfledged commanders, and their martial train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First make the circuit of the sandy plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around their sires, and, at the appointed sign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drawn up in beauteous order, form a line.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The second signal sounds, the troop divides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In three distinguished parts, with three distinguished guides.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again they close, and once again disjoin:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In troop to troop opposed, and line to line.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They meet; they wheel; they throw their darts afar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With harmless rage, and well-dissembled war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then in a round the mingled bodies run:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flying they follow, and pursuing shun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broken, they break; and, rallying, they renew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In other forms the military show.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last, in order undiscerned they join,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And march together in a friendly line.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as the Cretan labyrinth of old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With wandering ways, and many a winding fold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Involved the weary feet, without redress,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a round error, which denied recess;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So fought the Trojan boys in warlike play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turned and returned, and still a different way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus dolphins, in the deep, each other chase<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In circles, when they swim around the watery race.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This game, these carousals, Ascanius taught;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, building Alba, to the Latins brought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shewed what he learned: the Latin sires impart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To their succeeding sons the graceful art:<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
<span class="i0">From these imperial Rome received the game,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which Troy, the youths the Trojan troop, they name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus far the sacred sports they celebrate:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Fortune soon resumed her ancient hate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, while they pay the dead his annual dues,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those envied rites Saturnian Juno views;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sends the goddess of the various bow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To try new methods of revenge below;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Supplies the winds to wing her airy way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where in the port secure the navy lay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swiftly fair Iris down her arch descends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, undiscerned, her fatal voyage ends.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She saw the gathering crowd; and, gliding thence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The desert shore, and fleet without defence.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Trojan matrons, on the sands alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sighs and tears Anchises' death bemoan:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, turning to the sea their weeping eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their pity to themselves renews their cries.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Alas!" said one, "what oceans yet remain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For us to sail! what labours to sustain!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All take the word, and, with a general groan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Implore the gods for peace, and places of their own.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The goddess, great in mischief, views their pains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in a woman's form her heavenly limbs restrains.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In face and shape, old Bero&euml; she became,       <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doryclus' wife, a venerable dame,              <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once blessed with riches, and a mother's name. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus changed, amidst the crying crowd she ran,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mixed with the matrons, and these words began:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O wretched we! whom not the Grecian power,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor flames, destroyed, in Troy's unhappy hour!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O wretched we! reserved by cruel Fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the ruins of the sinking state!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now seven revolving years are wholly run,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since this improsperous voyage we begun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since, tossed from shores to shores, from lands to lands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inhospitable rocks and barren sands,<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Wandering in exile, through the stormy sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We search in vain for flying Italy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now cast by Fortune on this kindred land,        <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">What should our rest and rising walls withstand, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or hinder here to fix our banished band?         <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">O country lost, and gods redeemed in vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If still in endless exile we remain!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall we no more the Trojan walls renew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or streams of some dissembled Simo&iuml;s view?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Haste! join with me! the unhappy fleet consume!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cassandra bids; and I declare her doom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sleep I saw her; she supplied my hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(For this I more than dreamt) with flaming brands:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'With these, (said she,) these wandering ships destroy: <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">These are your fatal seats, and this your Troy.'        <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Time calls you now; the precious hour employ:           <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slack not the good presage, while heaven inspires<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our minds to dare, and gives the ready fires.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">See! Neptune's altars minister their brands:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The god is pleased; the god supplies our hands."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, from the pile, a flaming fir she drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, tossed in air, amidst the galleys threw.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rapt in amaze, the matrons wildly stare:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Pyrgo, reverenced for her hoary hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pyrgo, the nurse of Priam's numerous race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"No Bero&euml; this, though she belies her face!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What terrors from her frowning front arise!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold a goddess in her ardent eyes!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What rays around her heavenly face are seen!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mark her majestic voice, and more than mortal mien!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bero&euml; but now I left, whom, pined with pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her age and anguish from these rites detain."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She said. The matrons, seized with new amaze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Roll their malignant eyes, and on the navy gaze.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They fear, and hope, and neither part obey:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They hope the fated land, but fear the fatal way.<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The goddess, having done her task below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mounts up on equal wings, and bends her painted bow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Struck with the sight, and seized with rage divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The matrons prosecute their mad design:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They shriek aloud; they snatch, with impious hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The food of altars; firs and flaming brands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Green boughs and saplings, mingled in their haste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And smoking torches, on the ships they cast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The flame, unstopped at first, more fury gains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Vulcan rides at large with loosened reins:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Triumphant to the painted sterns he soars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seizes, in his way, the banks and crackling oars.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eumelus was the first, the news to bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While yet they crowd the rural theatre.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, what they hear, is witnessed by their eyes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A storm of sparkles, and of flames, arise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ascanius took the alarm, while yet he led<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His early warriors on his prancing steed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, spurring on, his equals soon o'erpassed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor could his frighted friends reclaim his haste.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon as the royal youth appeared in view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sent his voice before him as he flew:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What madness moves you, matrons! to destroy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The last remainders of unhappy Troy?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not hostile fleets, but your own hopes, you burn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on your friends your fatal fury turn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold your own Ascanius!"&mdash;While he said,   <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">He drew his glittering helmet from his head,      <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In which the youths to sportful arms he led.      <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">By this, &AElig;neas and his train appear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now the women, seized with shame and fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dispersed, to woods and caverns take their flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Abhor their actions, and avoid the light;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their friends acknowledge, and their error find,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shake the goddess from their altered mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Not so the raging fires their fury cease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, lurking in the seams, with seeming peace,<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Work on their way amid the smouldering tow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sure in destruction, but in motion slow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The silent plague through the green timber eats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And vomits out a tardy flame by fits.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down to the keels, and upward to the sails,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fire descends, or mounts, but still prevails;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor buckets poured, nor strength of human hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can the victorious element withstand.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The pious hero rends his robe, and throws<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To heaven his hands, and, with his hands, his vows.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O Jove! (he cried,) if prayers can yet have place;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thou abhorr'st not all the Dardan race;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If any spark of pity still remain;          <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">If gods are gods, and not invoked in vain;  <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet spare the reliques of the Trojan train! <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet from the flames our burning vessels free!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or let thy fury fall alone on me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At this devoted head thy thunder throw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And send the willing sacrifice below."<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Scarce had he said, when southern storms arise:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From pole to pole the forky lightning flies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loud rattling shakes the mountains and the plain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heaven bellies downward, and descends in rain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whole sheets of water from the clouds are sent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, hissing through the planks, the flames prevent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stop the fiery pest. Four ships alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burn to the waist, and for the fleet atone.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">But doubtful thoughts the hero's heart divide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If he should still in Sicily reside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forgetful of his fates,&mdash;or tempt the main,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To tell events, and what the fates required&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus while he stood, to neither part inclined,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Whither so fast?" the filial duty cried;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"And why, ah! why the wished embrace denied?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said, and rose: as holy zeal inspires,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">High on the deck the godlike hero stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With olive crowned, a charger in his hands;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then cast the reeking entrails in the brine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And poured the sacrifice of purple wine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fresh gales arise; with equal strokes they vie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And brush the buxom seas, and o'er the billows fly.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Meantime the mother goddess, full of fears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Neptune thus addressed, with tender tears:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The pride of Jove's imperious queen, the rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The malice, which no sufferings can assuage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Compel me to these prayers; since neither fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor time, nor pity, can remove her hate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even Jove is thwarted by his haughty wife;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still vanquished, yet she still renews the strife.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if 'twere little to consume the town<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which awed the world, and wore the imperial crown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She prosecutes the ghost of Troy with pains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gnaws, e'en to the bones, the last remains.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let her the causes of her hatred tell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But you can witness its effects too well.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You saw the storm she raised on Libyan floods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That mixed the mounting billows with the clouds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, bribing &AElig;olus, she shook the main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And moved rebellion in your watery reign.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fury she possessed the Dardan dames,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To burn their fleet with execrable flames,<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And forced &AElig;neas, when his ships were lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To leave his followers on a foreign coast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For what remains, your godhead I implore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And trust my son to your protecting power.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If neither Jove's nor Fate's decree withstand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secure his passage to the Latian land."<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Then thus the mighty Ruler of the Main:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What may not Venus hope from Neptune's reign?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My kingdom claims your birth; my late defence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of your endangered fleet may claim your confidence.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor less by land than sea my deeds declare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How much your loved &AElig;neas is my care.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thee, Xanthus! and thee, Simo&iuml;s! I attest&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your Trojan troops when proud Achilles pressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drove before him headlong on the plain,       <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dashed against the walls the trembling train; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">When floods were filled with bodies of the slain; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">When crimson Xanthus, doubtful of his way,      <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood up on ridges to behold the sea,           <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">New heaps came tumbling in, and choked his way; <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">When your &AElig;neas fought, but fought with odds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of force unequal, and unequal gods;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I spread a cloud before the victor's sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sustained the vanquished, and secured his flight&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even then secured him, when I sought with joy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vowed destruction of ungrateful Troy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My will's the same: fair goddess! fear no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your fleet shall safely gain the Latian shore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their lives are given; one destined head alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall perish, and for multitudes atone."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus having armed with hopes her anxious mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His finny team Saturnian Neptune joined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then adds the foamy bridle to their jaws,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the loosened reins permits the laws.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High on the waves his azure car he guides;   <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its axles thunder, and the sea subsides,     <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the smooth ocean rolls her silent tides. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The tempests fly before their father's face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trains of inferior gods his triumph grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And monster whales before their master play,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And choirs of Tritons crowd the watery way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The marshalled powers in equal troops divide             <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To right and left; the gods his better side              <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inclose; and, on the worse, the Nymphs and Nereids ride. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i4">Now smiling hope, with sweet vicissitude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within the hero's mind his joys renewed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He calls to raise the masts, the sheets display; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cheerful crew with diligence obey;           <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">They scud before the wind, and sail in open sea. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A-head of all the master-pilot steers;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as he leads, the following navy veers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The steeds of Night had travelled half the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The drowsy rowers on their benches lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the soft God of Sleep, with easy flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Descends, and draws behind a trail of light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou, Palinurus, art his destined prey;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To thee alone he takes his fatal way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dire dreams to thee, and iron sleep, he bears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, lighting on thy prow, the form of Phorbas wears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then thus the traitor god began his tale:&mdash;     <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The winds, my friend, inspire a pleasing gale; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ships, without thy care, securely sail.     <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now steal an hour of sweet repose; and I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will take the rudder, and thy room supply."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To whom the yawning pilot, half-asleep:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Me dost thou bid to trust the treacherous deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The harlot-smiles of her dissembling face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to her faith commit the Trojan race?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall I believe the Siren South again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, oft betrayed, not know the monster main?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said: his fastened hands the rudder keep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, fixed on heaven, his eyes repel invading sleep.<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The god was wroth, and at his temples threw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A branch in Lethe dipped, and drunk with Stygian dew:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pilot, vanquished by the power divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon closed his swimming eyes, and lay supine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce were his limbs extended at their length,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The god, insulting with superior strength,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell heavy on him, plunged him in the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, with the stern, the rudder tore away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Headlong he fell, and, struggling in the main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cried out for helping hands, but cried in vain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The victor D&aelig;mon mounts obscure in air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While the ship sails without the pilot's care.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Neptune's faith the floating fleet relies;        <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But what the man forsook, the god supplies,          <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, o'er the dangerous deep, secure the navy flies; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glides by the Sirens' cliffs, a shelfy coast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long infamous for ships and sailors lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And white with bones. The impetuous ocean roars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rocks rebellow from the sounding shores.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The watchful hero felt the knocks; and found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tossing vessel sailed on shoaly ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sure of his pilot's loss, he takes himself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The helm, and steers aloof, and shuns the shelf.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inly he grieved, and, groaning from the breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deplored his death; and thus his pain expressed:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"For faith reposed on seas, and on the flattering sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy naked corpse is doomed on shores unknown to lie."<br /></span>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_104_104"></a><a href="#FNanchor_104_104"><span class="label">[104]</span></a> A great part of this book is borrowed from Apollonius Rhodius;
and the reader may observe the great judgment and distinction
tion of our author, in what he borrows from the ancients, by comparing
them. I conceive the reason why he omits the horse-race
in the funeral games, was, because he shows Ascanius afterwards
on horseback, with his troops of boys, and would not wear that
subject thread-bare, which Statius, in the next age, described so
happily. Virgil seems, to me, to have excelled Homer in those
sports, and to have laboured them the more in honour of Octavius,
his patron, who instituted the like games for perpetuating the memory
of his uncle Julius: piety, as Virgil calls it, or dutifulness to
parents, being a most popular virtue among the Romans.</p>

eminence of rank. Ascanius was the last in order, but the first in
dignity; this, by the way, is an Ovidian point superinduced upon
the simplicity of Virgil:

BOOK VI.</h2>


<p class="center font10 pmb1">ARGUMENT.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="ii1 pmb2"><i>The Sibyl foretels &AElig;neas the adventures he should meet with in
Italy. She attends him to hell; describing to him the various
scenes of that place, and conducting him to his father Anchises,
who instructs him in those sublime mysteries of the soul of the
world, and the transmigration; and shews him that glorious race
of heroes, which was to descend from him and his posterity.</i></p>

<span class="i0">He said, and wept; then spread his sails before   <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The winds, and reached at length the Cuman shore:       <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their anchors dropped, his crew the vessels moor. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">They turn their heads to sea, their sterns to land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And greet with greedy joy the Italian strand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some strike from clashing flints their fiery seed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some gather sticks, the kindled flames to feed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or search for hollow trees, and fell the woods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or trace through valleys the discovered floods.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus while their several charges they fulfil,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pious prince ascends the sacred hill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Ph&oelig;bus is adored; and seeks the shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which hides from sight his venerable maid.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Deep in a cave the Sibyl makes abode;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thence full of Fate returns, and of the god.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through Trivia's grove they walk; and now behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And enter now, the temple roofed with gold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When D&aelig;dalus, to fly the Cretan shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His heavy limbs on jointed pinions bore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(The first who sailed in air,) 'tis sung by Fame,       <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the Cum&aelig;an coast at length he came,            <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, here alighting, built this costly frame.           <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inscribed to Ph&oelig;bus, here he hung on high<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The steerage of his wings, that cut the sky:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, o'er the lofty gate, his art embossed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Androgeos' death, and (offerings to his ghost)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seven youths from Athens yearly sent, to meet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fate appointed by revengeful Crete.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And next to these the dreadful urn was placed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In which the destined names by lots were cast:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mournful parents stand around in tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rising Crete against their shore appears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There too, in living sculpture, might be seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mad affection of the Cretan queen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then how she cheats her bellowing lover's eye;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rushing leap, the doubtful progeny&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lower part a beast, a man above&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The monument of their polluted love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor far from thence he graved the wonderous maze,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thousand doors, a thousand winding ways:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here dwells the monster, hid from human view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not to be found, but by the faithful clue;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the kind artist, moved with pious grief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lent to the loving maid this last relief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all those erring paths described so well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Theseus conquered, and the monster fell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here hapless Icarus had found his part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had not the father's grief restrained his art.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He twice essayed to cast his son in gold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twice from his hands he dropped the forming mould.<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
<span class="i4">All this with wondering eyes &AElig;neas viewed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each varying object his delight renewed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eager to read the rest...Achates came,       <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by his side the mad divining dame,       <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The priestess of the god, De&iuml;phobe her name. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Time suffers not," she said, "to feed your eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With empty pleasures; haste the sacrifice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seven bullocks, yet unyoked, for Ph&oelig;bus chuse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for Diana seven unspotted ewes."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This said, the servants urge the sacred rites,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While to the temple she the prince invites.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A spacious cave, within its farmost part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was hewed and fashioned by laborious art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the hill's hollow sides: before the place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A hundred doors a hundred entries grace:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As many voices issue, and the sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Sibyl's words as many times rebound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now to the mouth they come. Aloud she cries,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"This is the time! inquire your destinies!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He comes! behold the god!" Thus while she said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(And shivering at the sacred entry staid,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her colour changed; her face was not the same,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hollow groans from her deep spirit came.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her hair stood up; convulsive rage possessed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her trembling limbs, and heaved her labouring breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Greater than human kind she seemed to look,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, with an accent more than mortal, spoke.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her staring eyes with sparkling fury roll,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When all the god came rushing on her soul.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swiftly she turned, and, foaming as she spoke,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Why this delay?" she cried&mdash;"the powers invoke.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy prayers alone can open this abode;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Else vain are my demands, and dumb the god."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She said no more. The trembling Trojans hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er-spread with a damp sweat, and holy fear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The prince himself, with awful dread possessed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His vows to great Apollo thus addressed:&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Directed by whose hand, the Dardan dart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pierced the proud Grecian's only mortal part!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus far, by Fate's decrees and thy commands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through ambient seas and through devouring sands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our exiled crew has sought the Ausonian ground;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now, at length, the flying coast is found.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus far the fate of Troy, from place to place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fury has pursued her wandering race.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here cease, ye powers, and let your vengeance end:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Troy is no more, and can no more offend.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To conquer and command the Latian state;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To fix my wandering gods, and find a place<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Which, by thy mouth, Apollo shall convey&mdash;-<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All shall be treasured by a chosen train<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of holy priests, and ever shall remain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, oh! commit not thy prophetic mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To flitting leaves, the sport of every wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest they disperse in air our empty fate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Write not, but, what the powers ordain, relate."<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Struggling in vain, impatient of her load,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And labouring underneath the ponderous god,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The more she strove to shake him from her breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With more and far superior force he pressed;<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Commands his entrance, and, without controul,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Now, with a furious blast, the hundred doors   <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ope of themselves; a rushing whirlwind roars   <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within the cave, and Sibyl's voice restores:&mdash; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Escaped the dangers of the watery reign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet more and greater ills by land remain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The coast, so long desired, (nor doubt the event,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy troops shall reach, but, having reached, repent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wars, horrid wars, I view&mdash;a field of blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Tyber rolling with a purple flood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Simo&iuml;s nor Xanthus shall be wanting there:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A new Achilles shall in arms appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he, too, goddess-born. Fierce Juno's hate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Added to hostile force, shall urge thy fate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To what strange nations shalt not thou resort,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Driven to solicit aid at every court!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cause the same which Ilium once oppressed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A foreign mistress, and a foreign guest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thou, secure of soul, unbent with woes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The more thy fortune frowns, the more oppose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dawnings of thy safety shall be shown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From, whence thou least shall hope, a Grecian town."<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Thus, from the dark recess, the Sibyl spoke, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the resisting air the thunder broke;       <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cave rebellowed, and the temple shook.     <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ambiguous god, who ruled her labouring breast, <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In these mysterious words his mind expressed;      <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">At length her fury fell, her foaming ceased,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, ebbing in her soul, the god decreased.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">This let me crave&mdash;since near your grove the road <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hell lies open, and the dark abode,            <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which Acheron surrounds, the innavigable flood&mdash;  <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conduct me through the regions void of light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lead me longing to my father's sight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For him, a thousand dangers I have sought,       <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, rushing where the thickest Grecians fought, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Safe on my back the sacred burden brought.       <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">He, for my sake, the raging ocean tried,             <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wrath of heaven, (my still auspicious guide,)    <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bore, beyond the strength decrepit age supplied. <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft, since he breathed his last, in dead of night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His reverend image stood before my sight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enjoined to seek, below, his holy shade&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conducted there by your unerring aid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But you, if pious minds by prayers are won,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oblige the father, and protect the son.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yours is the power; nor Proserpine in vain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has made you priestess of her nightly reign.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If Orpheus, armed with his enchanting lyre,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ruthless king with pity could inspire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the shades below redeem his wife;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If Pollux, offering his alternate life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could free his brother, and can daily go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By turns aloft, by turns descend below;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why name I Theseus, or his greater friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who trod the downward path, and upward could ascend?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not less than theirs, from Jove my lineage came;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My mother greater, my descent the same."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So prayed the Trojan prince, and, while he prayed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hand upon the holy altar laid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then thus replied the prophetess divine:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O goddess-born, of great Anchises' line!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gates of hell are open night and day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smooth the descent, and easy is the way:<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But, to return, and view the cheerful skies&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this the task and mighty labour lies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To few great Jupiter imparts this grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And those of shining worth, and heavenly race.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt those regions and our upper light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep forests and impenetrable night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Possess the middle space: the infernal bounds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cocytus, with his sable waves, surrounds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, if so dire a love your soul invades,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As twice below to view the trembling shades;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you so hard a toil will undertake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As twice to pass the innavigable lake;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Receive my counsel. In the neighbouring grove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There stands a tree; the queen of Stygian Jove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Claims it her own; thick woods and gloomy night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conceal the happy plant from human sight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One bough it bears; but (wonderous to behold!)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ductile rind and leaves of radiant gold:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This from the vulgar branches must be torn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to fair Proserpine the present borne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere leave be given to tempt the nether skies. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first thus rent, a second will arise,     <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the same metal the same room supplies.    <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look round the wood, with lifted eyes, to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lurking gold upon the fatal tree:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then rend it off, as holy rites command;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The willing metal will obey thy hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Following with ease, if, favoured by thy fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art foredoomed to view the Stygian state:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If not, no labour can the tree constrain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strength of stubborn arms, and steel, are vain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besides, you know not, while you here attend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The unworthy fate of your unhappy friend:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breathless he lies; and his unburied ghost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deprived of funeral rites, pollutes your host.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pay first his pious dues; and, for the dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two sable sheep around his hearse be led;<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then, living turfs upon his body lay:      <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">This done, securely take the destined way, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To find the regions destitute of day."     <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">She said, and held her peace.&mdash;&AElig;neas went   <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sad from the cave, and full of discontent,  <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unknowing whom the sacred Sibyl meant.      <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Achates, the companion of his breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Goes grieving by his side, with equal cares oppressed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Walking, they talked, and fruitlessly divined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What friend the priestess by those words designed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But soon they found an object to deplore:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Misenus lay extended on the shore&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Son of the god of winds:&mdash;none so renowned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The warrior trumpet in the field to sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With breathing brass to kindle fierce alarms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rouse to dare their fate in honourable arms.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He served great Hector, and was ever near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not with his trumpet only, but his spear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, by Pelides' arms when Hector fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He chose &AElig;neas; and he chose as well.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Swoln with applause, and aiming still at more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He now provokes the sea-gods from the shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With envy, Triton heard the martial sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the bold champion, for his challenge, drowned;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then cast his mangled carcase on the strand:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gazing crowd around the body stand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All weep; but most &AElig;neas mourns his fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hastens to perform the funeral state.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In altar-wise, a stately pile they rear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The basis broad below, and top advanced in air.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An ancient wood, fit for the work designed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(The shady covert of the savage kind,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Trojans found: the sounding axe is plied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Firs, pines, and pitch trees, and the towering pride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of forest ashes, feel the fatal stroke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And piercing wedges cleave the stubborn oak.<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Huge trunks of trees, felled from the steepy crown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the bare mountains, roll with ruin down.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Armed like the rest the Trojan prince appears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, by his pious labour, urges theirs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus while he wrought, revolving in his mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ways to compass what his wish designed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He cast his eyes upon the gloomy grove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then with vows implored the queen of love:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O! may thy power, propitious still to me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Conduct my steps to find the fatal tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this deep forest; since the Sibyl's breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Foretold, alas! too true, Misenus' death."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scarce had he said, when, full before his sight, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two doves, descending from their airy flight,    <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secure upon the grassy plain alight.             <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">He knew his mother's birds; and thus he prayed:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Be you my guides, with your auspicious aid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lead my footsteps, till the branch be found,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose glittering shadow gilds the sacred ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou, great parent! with celestial care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this distress, be present to my prayer."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus having said, he stopped, with watchful sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Observing still the motions of their flight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What course they took, what happy signs they shew. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">They fed, and, fluttering, by degrees withdrew     <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still farther from the place, but still in view:   <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hopping and flying thus, they led him on<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the slow lake, whose baleful stench to shun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They winged their flight aloft, then, stooping low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perched on the double tree, that bears the golden bough.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the green leaves the glittering shadows glow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As, on the sacred oak, the wintery misletoe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the proud mother views her precious brood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And happier branches, which she never sowed.<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Such was the glittering; such the ruddy rind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dancing leaves, that wantoned in the wind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He seized the shining bough with griping hold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rent away, with ease, the lingering gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then to the Sibyl's palace bore the prize.      <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meantime, the Trojan troops, with weeping eyes, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To dead Misenus pay his obsequies.              <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">First, from the ground, a lofty pile they rear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of pitch-trees, oaks, and pines, and unctuous fir:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fabric's front with cypress twigs they strew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stick the sides with boughs of baleful yew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The topmost part his glittering arms adorn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Warm waters, then, in brazen cauldrons borne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are poured to wash his body, joint by joint,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fragrant oils the stiffened limbs anoint.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With groans and cries Misenus they deplore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then on a bier, with purple covered o'er,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The breathless body, thus bewailed, they lay,    <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fire the pile, their faces turned away:      <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Such reverent rites their fathers used to pay.) <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pure oil and incense on the fire they throw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fat of victims, which his friends bestow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These gifts the greedy flames to dust devour;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, on the living coals, red wine they pour;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, last, the reliques by themselves dispose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which in a brazen urn the priests inclose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Coryn&aelig;us compassed thrice the crew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dipped an olive-branch in holy dew;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which thrice he sprinkled round, and thrice aloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Invoked the dead, and then dismissed the crowd.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">But good &AElig;neas ordered on the shore&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A stately tomb, whose top a trumpet bore,                     <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A soldier's faulchion, and a seaman's oar.                    <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus was his friend interred; and deathless fame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still to the lofty cape consigns his name.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">These rites performed, the prince, without delay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hastes, to the nether world, his destined way.<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Deep was the cave; and, downward as it went<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the wide mouth, a rocky rough descent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here the access a gloomy grove defends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here the innavigable lake extends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er whose unhappy waters, void of light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No bird presumes to steer his airy flight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such deadly stenches from the depth arise,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Seven brawny bulls with his own hand he kills:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, on the broiling entrails, oil he pours;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Late the nocturnal sacrifice begun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor ended, till the next returning sun.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His course from Afric to the Latian shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell headlong down. The Trojan fixed his view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And scarcely through the gloom the sullen shadow knew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then thus the prince:&mdash;"What envious power, O friend!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought your loved life to this disastrous end?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Ph&oelig;bus, ever true in all he said,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The god foretold you should not die, before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You reached, secure from seas, the Italian shore.<br /></span>

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
<span class="i0">I fell; and, with my weight, the helm constrained<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Now by the winds and raging waves I swear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your safety, more than mine, was then my care;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest, of the guide bereft, the rudder lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your ship should run against the rocky coast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three blustering nights, borne by the southern blast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I floated, and discovered land at last:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High on a mounting wave, my head I bore,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The cruel nation, covetous of prey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stained with my blood the unhospitable coast;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With watching overworn, with cares oppressed, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unhappy I had laid me down to rest,           <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>

the printer, with Dr Carey, who reads <i>prayers</i>. But Dryden's
rhymes are in general exceedingly accurate; and many of the examples
to the contrary, quoted by Dr Carey, only seem less so to us, by
the fluctuation of the mode of pronouncing. I strongly believe,
for example, that the word <i>sea</i> was formerly pronounced somewhat
like <i>say</i>; for all the poets, down to Pope inclusive, make it

has taken notice of it. Self-murder was accounted a great crime
by that divine philosopher; but the instances which he brings
are too many to be inserted in these short notes. Sir Robert
Howard, in his translation of this &AElig;ne&iuml;d, which was printed with
his poems in the year 1660, has given us the most learned and the
most judicious observations on this book, which are extant in our
language.</p>

<p>These two verses in English seem very different from the
Latin&mdash;</p>

<p class="pmb3">Yet they are the sense of Virgil; at least, according to the common
interpretation of this place&mdash;"I will withdraw from your
company, retire to the shades, and perform my penance of a thousand
years." But I must confess, the interpretation of those two
words, <i>explebo numerum</i>, is somewhat violent, if it be thus understood,
<i>minuam numerum</i>; that is, I will lessen your company by
my departure: for De&iuml;phobus, being a ghost, can hardly be said to
be of their number. Perhaps the poet means by <i>explebo numerum,
absolvam sententiam;</i> as if De&iuml;phobus replied to the Sibyl, who
was angry at his long visit, "I will only take my last leave of
&AElig;neas, my kinsman and my friend, with one hearty good wish for
his health and welfare, and then leave you to prosecute your voyage."
That wish is expressed in the words immediately following,
<i>I, decus, i, nostrum</i>, &amp;c. which contain a direct answer to
what the Sibyl said before, when she upbraided their long discourse,
<i>nos flendo ducimus horas</i>. This conjecture is new, and
therefore left to the discretion of the reader.</p>

<span class="i0">Know, first, that heaven, and earth's compacted frame,<br /></span>

</div></div>
</div>

<p class="pmb3">Here the sun is not expressed, but the moon only, though a
less, and also a less radiant, light. Perhaps the copies of Virgil
are all false, and that, instead of <i>Titaniaque astra</i>, he writ, <i>Titaniaque,
et astra</i>; and according to these words I have made my
translation. It is most certain, that the sun ought not to be omitted;
for he is frequently called the life and soul of the world: and
nothing bids so fair for a visible divinity to those who know no
better, than that glorious luminary. The Platonists call God the
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
archetypal sun, and the sun the visible deity, the inward vital
spirit in the centre of the universe, or that body to which that
spirit is united, and by which it exerts itself most powerfully.
Now it was the received hypothesis amongst the Pythagoreans,
that the sun was situate in the centre of the world. Plato had it
from them, and was himself of the same opinion, as appears by a
passage in the <i>Tim&aelig;us;</i> from which noble dialogue is this part of
Virgil's poem taken.</p>

<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Quis te, magne Cato</i>, &amp;c.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>There is no question but Virgil here means Cato Major, or
the censor. But the name of Cato being also mentioned in the
Eighth &AElig;ne&iuml;d, I doubt whether he means the same man in both
places. I have said in the preface, that our poet was of republican
principles; and have given this for one reason of my opinion,
that he praised Cato in that line,</p>

<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Secretosque pios, his dantem jura Catonem</i>&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>and accordingly placed him in the Elysian fields. Montaigne
thinks this was Cato the Utican, the great enemy of arbitrary
power, and a professed foe to Julius C&aelig;sar. Ru&aelig;us would persuade
us that Virgil meant the censor. But why should the poet
name Cato twice, if he intended the same person? Our author is
too frugal of his words and sense, to commit tautologies in either.
His memory was not likely to betray him into such an error.
Nevertheless I continue in the same opinion concerning the principles
of our poet. He declares them sufficiently in this book,
where he praises the first Brutus for expelling the Tarquins, giving
liberty to Rome, and putting to death his own children, who conspired
to restore tyranny. He calls him only an unhappy man,
for being forced to that severe action&mdash;</p>

<p>Let the reader weigh these two verses, and he must be convinced
that I am in the right, and that I have not much injured
my master in my translation of them.</p>

<span class="i0"><i>Thou of my blood, who bear'st the Julian name.</i>&mdash;P. 420.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This note, which is out of its proper place, I deferred on purpose,
to place it here, because it discovers the principles of our
poet more plainly than any of the rest.</p>

</div>

<p>Anchises here speaks to Julius C&aelig;sar, and commands him first
to lay down his arms; which is a plain condemnation of his cause.
Yet observe our poet's incomparable address; for, though he
shews himself sufficiently to be a commonwealth's man, yet, in
respect to Augustus, who was his patron, he uses the authority of
a parent, in the person of Anchises, who had more right to lay
this injunction on C&aelig;sar than on Pompey, because the latter was
not of his blood. Thus our author cautiously veils his own opinion,
and takes sanctuary under Anchises; as if that ghost would
have laid the same command on Pompey also, had he been lineally
descended from him. What could be more judiciously contrived,
when this was the &AElig;ne&iuml;d which he chose to read before his
master?</p>

<span class="i0"><i>A new Marcellus shall arise in thee.</i>&mdash;P. 423.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>In Virgil thus:</p>

<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Tu Marcellus eris</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>How unpoetically and badly had this been translated, <i>Thou
shalt Marcellus be</i>! Yet some of my friends were of opinion, that
I mistook the sense of Virgil in my translation. The French interpreter
observes nothing on this place, but that it appears by it,
the mourning of Octavia was yet fresh for the loss of her son Marcellus,
whom she had by her first husband, and who died in the
year <i>ab urbe condit&acirc;</i>, 731; and collects from thence, that Virgil,
reading this &AElig;ne&iuml;d before her in the same year, had just finished
it; that, from this time to that of the poet's death, was little more
than four years; so that, supposing him to have written the whole
&AElig;ne&iuml;s in eleven years, the first six books must have taken up
seven of those years; on which account, the six last must of necessity
be less correct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, for the false judgment of my friends, there is but this
little to be said for them; the words of Virgil, in the verse preceding,
are these,</p>

<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">----<i>Siqu&acirc; fata aspera rumpas</i>&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="pmb1">as if the poet had meant, "if you break through your hard destiny,
so as to be born, you shall be called Marcellus:" but this
cannot be the sense; for, though Marcellus was born, yet he
broke not through those hard decrees, which doomed him to so
immature a death. Much less can Virgil mean, "you shall be
the same Marcellus by the transmigration of his soul:" for, according
to the system of our author, a thousand years must be
first elapsed, before the soul can return into a human body: but
the first Marcellus was slain in the second Punic war; and
how many hundred years were yet wanting to the accomplishing
his penance, may with ease be gathered, by computing the
time betwixt Scipio and Augustus. By which it is plain, that
Virgil cannot mean the same Marcellus; but one of his descendants,
whom I call a new Marcellus, who so much resembled his
ancestor, perhaps in his features and his person, but certainly in
his military virtues, that Virgil cries out, <i>quantum instar in ipso
est!</i> which I have translated,</p>

<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">How like the former, and almost the same!<br /></span>

<span class="i0"><i>Two gates the silent house of Sleep adorn;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Of polished ivory this, that of transparent horn.</i>&mdash;P. 423.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="pmb1">Virgil borrowed this imagination from Homer, Odysses xix.
line 562. The translation gives the reason, why true prophetic
dreams are said to pass through the gate of horn, by adding the
epithet <i>transparent</i>, which is not in Virgil, whose words are only
these:</p>

<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Sunt gemin&aelig; Somni port&aelig;, quarum altera fertur</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Cornea</i>&mdash;&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="pmb3">What is pervious to the sight is clear; and (alluding to this
property) the poet infers such dreams are of divine revelation.
Such as pass through the ivory gate, are of the contrary nature&mdash;polished
lies. But there is a better reason to be given; for the
ivory alludes to the teeth, the horn to the eyes. What we see
is more credible, than what we only hear; that is, words that
pass through the portal of the mouth, or "<i>hedge of the teeth</i>;"
which is Homer's expression for <i>speaking</i>.</p>

<p class="ii1 pmb1"><i>King Latinus entertains &AElig;neas, and promises him his only daughter,
Lavinia, the heiress of his crown. Turnus, being in love with her,
favoured by her mother, and stirred up by Juno and Alecto, breaks

Camilla, Messapus, and many other of the neighbouring

<span class="i4">The Trojan, from the main, beheld a wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which thick with shades, and a brown horror, stood:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt the trees the Tyber took his course,<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Now, Erato! thy poet's mind inspire,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Relate what Latium was; her ancient kings;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Declare the past and present state of things,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For I shall sing of battles, blood, and rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which princes and their people did engage;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And haughty souls, that, moved with mutual hate,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That roused the Tyrrhene realm with loud alarms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And peaceful Italy involved in arms.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A larger scene of action is displayed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, rising hence, a greater work is weighed.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Latinus, old and mild, had long possessed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Latian sceptre, and his people blessed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His father Faunus: a Laurentian dame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His mother; fair Marica was her name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Faunus came from Picus: Picus drew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His birth from Saturn, if records be true.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus king Latinus, in the third degree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had Saturn author of his family.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But this old peaceful prince, as heaven decreed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was blessed with no male issue to succeed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His sons in blooming youth were snatched by fate:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One only daughter heired the royal state.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fired with her love, and with ambition led,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The neighbouring princes court her nuptial bed.<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Among the crowd, but far above the rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Young Turnus to the beauteous maid addressed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turnus, for high descent and graceful mien,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was first, and favoured by the Latian queen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With him she strove to join Lavinia's hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But dire portents the purposed match withstand.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Deep in the palace, of long growth, there stood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A laurel's trunk, a venerable wood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where rites divine were paid; whose holy hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was kept and cut with superstitious care.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This plant Latinus, when his town he walled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then found, and from the tree Laurentum called:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And last, in honour of his new abode,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He vowed the laurel to the laurel's god.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It happened once, (a boding prodigy!)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A swarm of bees, that cut the liquid sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Unknown from whence they took their airy flight,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the topmost branch in clouds alight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There, with their clasping feet, together clung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a long cluster from the laurel hung.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An ancient augur prophesied from hence:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Behold on Latian shores a foreign prince!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the same parts of heaven his navy stands,<span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the same parts on earth; his army lands;   <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The town he conquers, and the tower commands."<span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet more, when fair Lavinia fed the fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the gods, and stood beside her sire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Strange to relate!) the flames, involved in smoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of incense, from the sacred altar broke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Caught her dishevelled hair, and rich attire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her crown and jewels crackled in the fire:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From thence the fuming trail began to spread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lambent glories danced about her head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This new portent the seer with wonder views,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then pausing, thus his prophecy renews:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The nymph, who scatters flaming fires around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall shine with honour, shall herself be crowned,<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But, caused by her irrevocable fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">War shall the country waste, and change the state."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Latinus, frighted with this dire ostent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For counsel to his father Faunus went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sought the shades renowned for prophecy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which near Albunea's sulphurous fountain lie.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To those the Latian and the Sabine land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fly, when distressed, and thence relief demand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The priest on skins of offerings takes his ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nightly visions in his slumber sees;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A swarm of thin a&euml;rial shapes appears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, fluttering round his temples, deafs his ears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These he consults, the future fates to know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From powers above, and from the fiends below.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, for the god's advice, Latinus flies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Offering a hundred sheep for sacrifice:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their woolly fleeces, as the rites required,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He laid beneath him, and to rest retired.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sooner were his eyes in slumber bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, from above, a more than mortal sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Invades his ears; and thus the vision spoke:&mdash; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Seek not, my seed, in Latian bands to yoke    <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our fair Lavinia, nor the gods provoke.        <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A foreign son upon the shore descends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose martial fame from pole to pole extends.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Not Latium shall contain, nor Europe bound:   <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis theirs whate'er the sun surveys around." <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">These answers, in the silent night received,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The king himself divulged, the land believed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fame through all the neighbouring nations flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When now the Trojan navy was in view.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Beneath a shady tree, the hero spread&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His table on the turf, with cakes of bread;    <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
<span class="i0">They sate; and (not without the god's command)<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ascanius this observed, and, smiling, said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"See! we devour the plates on which we fed."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The speech had omen, that the Trojan race<br /></span>

<span class="i0">'When, on a foreign shore, instead of meat,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Remember on that happy coast to build,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with a trench inclose the fruitful field.'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This was that famine, this the fatal place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which ends the wandering of our exiled race.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, on to-morrow's dawn, your care employ,  <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Crown high the goblets with a cheerful draught;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enjoy the present hour; adjourn the future thought."<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Thus having said, the hero bound his brows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With leafy branches, then performed his vows;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adoring first the genius of the place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Earth, the mother of the heavenly race,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The nymphs, and native godheads yet unknown,<br /></span>

   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then heaven's high monarch thundered thrice aloud,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To learn the natives' names, their towns explore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The coasts, and trendings of the crooked shore:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Here warlike Latins hold the happy lands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pious chief, who sought by peaceful ways<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Above the portal, carved in cedar wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Placed in their ranks, their godlike grandsires stood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Saturn, with his crooked scythe, on high;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Italus, that led the colony;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ancient Janus, with his double face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bunch of keys, the porter of the place.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There stood Sabinus, planter of the vines;     <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">On a short pruning-hook his head reclines,     <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And studiously surveys his generous wines;     <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then warlike kings, who for their country fought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And honourable wounds from battle brought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Around the posts, hung helmets, darts, and spears,    <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And captive chariots, axes, shields, and bars,        <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And broken beaks of ships, the trophies of their wars.<span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the rest, as chief of all the band,     <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was Picus placed, a buckler in his hand,      <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His other waved a long divining wand.         <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Girt in his Gabine gown the hero sate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet could not with his art avoid his fate:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Circe long had loved the youth in vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till love, refused, converted to disdain:<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then, mixing powerful herbs, with magic art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She changed his form, who could not change his heart;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Constrained him in a bird, and made him fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With party-coloured plumes, a chattering pie.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this high temple, on a chair of state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The seat of audience, old Latinus sate;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then gave admission to the Trojan train;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus, with pleasing accents, he began:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Tell me, ye Trojans, for that name you own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor is your course upon our coasts unknown&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say what you seek, and whither were you bound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were you by stress of weather cast a-ground?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Such dangers of the sea are often seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And oft befal to miserable men,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or come, your shipping in our ports to lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spent and disabled in so long a way?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say what you want: the Latians you shall find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not forced to goodness, but by will inclined;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, since the time of Saturn's holy reign,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hospitable customs we retain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I call to mind (but time the tale has worn)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Aurunci told, that Dardanus, though born<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Latian plains, yet sought the Phrygian shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Samothracia, Samos called before.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Tuscan Corythum he claimed his birth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But after, when exempt from mortal earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From thence ascended to his kindred skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A god, and, as a god, augments their sacrifice."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said.&mdash;Ilioneus made this reply:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O king, of Faunus' royal family!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor wintery winds to Latium forced our way,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor did the stars our wandering course betray.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Willing we sought your shores; and, hither bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The port, so long desired, at length we found;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From our sweet homes and ancient realms expelled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great as the greatest that the sun beheld.<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The god began our line, who rules above;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as our race, our king descends from Jove:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hither are we come, by his command,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To crave admission in your happy land.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How dire a tempest, from Mycen&aelig; poured,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our plains, our temples, and our town, devoured;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What was the waste of war, what fierce alarms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shook Asia's crown with European arms;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even such have heard, if any such there be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose earth is bounded by the frozen sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And such as, born beneath the burning sky<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sultry sun, betwixt the tropics lie.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From that dire deluge, through the watery waste,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Such length of years, such various perils past,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last escaped, to Latium we repair,                <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To beg what you without your want may spare&mdash;   <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The common water, and the common air;                <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sheds which ourselves will build, and mean abodes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fit to receive and serve our banished gods.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor our admission shall your realm disgrace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor length of time our gratitude efface&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besides what endless honour you shall gain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To save and shelter Troy's unhappy train.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, by my sovereign, and his fate, I swear&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Renowned for faith in peace, for force in war&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oft our alliance other lands desired,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, what we seek of you, of us required.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Despise not then, that in our hands we bear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These holy boughs, and sue with words of prayer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fate and the gods, by their supreme command,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have doomed our ships to seek the Latian land.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To these abodes our fleet Apollo sends;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here Dardanus was born, and hither tends;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Tuscan Tyber rolls with rapid force,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where Numicus opes his holy source.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besides, our prince presents, with his request,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some small remains of what his sire possessed.<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_439">[Pg 439]</a></span>
<span class="i0">This golden charger, snatched from burning Troy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Anchises did in sacrifice employ:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This royal robe and this tiara wore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Priam, and this golden sceptre bore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In full assemblies, and in solemn games;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These purple vests were weaved by Dardan dames."<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Thus while he spoke, Latinus rolled around<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His eyes, and fixed a while upon the ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Intent he seemed, and anxious in his breast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not by the sceptre moved, or kingly vest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But pondering future things of wonderous weight&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Succession, empire, and his daughter's fate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On these he mused within his thoughtful mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then revolved what Faunus had divined.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This was the foreign prince, by fate decreed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To share his sceptre, and Lavinia's bed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This was the race, that sure portents foreshew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To sway the world, and land and sea subdue.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length he raised his cheerful head, and spoke:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The powers," said he, "the powers we both invoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To you, and yours, and mine, propitious be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And firm our purpose with their augury!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have what you ask; your presents I receive;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Land, where and when you please, with ample leave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Partake and use my kingdom as your own;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All shall be yours, while I command the crown.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, if my wished alliance please your king,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell him he should not send the peace, but bring:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then let him not a friend's embraces fear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The peace is made when I behold him here.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besides this answer, tell my royal guest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I add to his commands my own request:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only one daughter heirs my crown and state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom not our oracles, nor heaven, nor fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor frequent prodigies, permit to join<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With any native of the Ausonian line.<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
<span class="i0">A foreign son-in-law shall come from far,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Such is our doom,) a chief renowned in war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose race shall bear aloft the Latian name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And through the conquered world diffuse our fame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself to be the man the fates require,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I firmly judge, and, what I judge, desire."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said, and then on each bestowed a steed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three hundred horses, in high stables fed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood ready, shining all, and smoothly dressed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of these he chose the fairest and the best,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To mount the Trojan troop. At his command,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The steeds caparisoned with purple stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With golden trappings, glorious to behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And champ betwixt their teeth the foaming gold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then to his absent guest the king decreed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pair of coursers born of heavenly breed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who from their nostrils breathed etherial fire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom Circe stole from her celestial sire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By substituting mares produced on earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose wombs conceived a more than mortal birth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These draw the chariot which Latinus sends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the rich present to the prince commends.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sublime on stately steeds the Trojans borne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To their expecting lord with peace return.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">But jealous Juno, from Pachynus' height,&nbsp; &nbsp; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">As she from Argos took her airy flight,       <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beheld, with envious eyes, this hateful sight.<span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">She saw the Trojan, and his joyful train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Descend upon the shore, desert the main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Design a town, and, with unhoped success,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The embassadors return with promised peace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, pierced with pain, she shook her haughty head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sighed from her inward soul, and thus she said:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O hated offspring of my Phrygian foes!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O fates of Troy, which Juno's fates oppose!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could they not fall unpitied on the plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But slain revive, and taken 'scape again?<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
<span class="i0">When execrable Troy in ashes lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through fires and swords and seas they forced their way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then vanquished Juno must in vain contend,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her rage disarmed, her empire at an end!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breathless and tired, is all my fury spent?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or does my glutted spleen at length relent?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if 'twere little from their town to chase,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I through the seas pursued their exiled race;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Engaged the heavens, opposed the stormy main;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But billows roared, and tempests raged in vain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What have my Scyllas and my Syrtes done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When these they overpass, and those they shun?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Tyber's shores they land, secure of fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Triumphant o'er the storms and Juno's hate!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mars could in mutual blood the Centaurs bathe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Jove himself gave way to Cynthia's wrath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who sent the tusky boar to Calydon;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(What great offence had either people done?)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I, the consort of the Thunderer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have waged a long and unsuccessful war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With various arts and arms in vain have toiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And by a mortal man at length am foiled!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If native power prevail not, shall I doubt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To seek for needful succour from without?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If Jove and heaven my just desires deny,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hell shall the power of heaven and Jove supply.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grant that the Fates have firmed, by their decree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Trojan race to reign in Italy:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At least I can defer the nuptial day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, with protracted wars, the peace delay:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With blood the dear alliance shall be bought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And both the people near destruction brought;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So shall the son-in-law and father join,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With ruin, war, and waste of either line.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O fatal maid! thy marriage is endowed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Phrygian, Latian, and Rutulian blood!<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Thus having said, she sinks beneath the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With furious haste, and shoots the Stygian sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To rouse Alecto from the infernal seat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of her dire sisters, and their dark retreat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This Fury, fit for her intent, she chose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One who delights in wars, and human woes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even Pluto hates his own mis-shapen race;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her sister Furies fly her hideous face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So frightful are the forms the monster takes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So fierce the hissings of her speckled snakes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her Juno finds, and thus inflames her spite:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O virgin daughter of eternal Night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give me this once thy labour, to sustain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My right, and execute my just disdain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let not the Trojans, with a feigned pretence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of proffered peace, delude the Latian prince.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Expel from Italy that odious name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And let not Juno suffer in her fame.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Of envy, discord, and of cruel deeds:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confound the peace established, and prepare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their souls to hatred, and their hands to war."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smeared as she was with black Gorgonean blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Fury sprang above the Stygian flood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on her wicker wings, sublime through night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She to the Latian palace took her flight:<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
<span class="i0">There sought the queen's apartment, stood before<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Restless Amata lay, her swelling breast    <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fired with disdain for Turnus dispossessed,<span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the new nuptials of the Trojan guest.  <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">From her black bloody locks the Fury shakes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her darling plague, the favourite of her snakes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With her full force she threw the poisonous dart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fixed it deep within Amata's heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, thus envenomed, she might kindle rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sacrifice to strife her house and husband's age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unseen, unfelt, the fiery serpent skims<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt her linen and her naked limbs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His baleful breath inspiring as he glides.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now like a chain around her neck he rides,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now like a fillet to her head repairs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with his circling volumes folds her hairs.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At first the silent venom slid with ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seized her cooler senses by degrees;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, ere the infected mass was fired too far,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In plaintive accents she began the war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus bespoke her husband:&mdash;"Shall," she said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"A wandering prince enjoy Lavinia's bed?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If nature plead not in a parent's heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pity my tears, and pity her desert.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know, my dearest lord, the time will come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You would, in vain, reverse your cruel doom:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The faithless pirate soon will set to sea,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A guest like him, a Trojan guest before,       <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">In shew of friendship sought the Spartan shore,<span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ravished Helen from her husband bore.      <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Think on a king's inviolable word;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And think on Turnus, her once plighted lord.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But, when she saw her reasons idly spent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And could not move him from his fixed intent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She flew to rage; for now the snake possessed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her vital parts, and poisoned all her breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She raves, she runs with a distracted pace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fills, with horrid howls, the public place.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as young striplings whip the top for sport,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the smooth pavement of an empty court;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wooden engine flies and whirls about,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Admired, with clamours, of the beardless rout;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They lash aloud; each other they provoke,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Thus fares the queen; and thus her fury blows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amidst the crowd, and kindles as she goes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor yet content, she strains her malice more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And adds new ills to those contrived before:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She flies the town, and, mixing with a throng<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of madding matrons, bears the bride along,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wandering through woods and wilds, and devious ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with these arts the Trojan match delays.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She feigned the rites of Bacchus; cried aloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the buxom god the virgin vowed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Ev&aelig;! O Bacchus!" thus began the song;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And "Ev&aelig;!"<a id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> answered all the female throng.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"For thee she feeds her hair, she leads thy dance,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Like fury seized the rest: the progress known,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The queen herself, inspired with rage divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shook high above her head a flaming pine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then rolled her hagard eyes around the throng,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sung, in Turnus' name, the nuptial song:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I&ouml;! ye Latian dames, if any here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hold your unhappy queen, Amata, dear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If there be here," she said, "who dare maintain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My right, nor think the name of mother vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unbind your fillets, loose your flowing hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And orgies and nocturnal rites prepare."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amata's breast the Fury thus invades,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fires with rage, amid the sylvan shades.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, when she found her venom spread so far,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The royal house embroiled in civil war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Raised on her dusky wings, she cleaves the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And seeks the palace where young Turnus lies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His town, as Fame reports, was built of old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Dana&euml;, pregnant with almighty gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who fled her father's rage, and, with a train          <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of following Argives, through the stormy main,         <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>

<span class="i4">'Twas Ardua once: now Ardea's name it bears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Once a fair city, now consumed with years;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here, in his lofty palace, Turnus lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt the confines of the night and day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secure in sleep.&mdash;The Fury laid aside          <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her looks and limbs, and with new methods tried     <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Propped on a staff, she takes a trembling mien:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Deep-dinted wrinkles on her cheek she draws;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sunk are her eyes, and toothless are her jaws;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her hoary hair with holy fillets bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her temples with an olive wreath are crowned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Chalybe, who kept the sacred fane                   <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Juno, now she seemed, and thus began,                <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Appearing in a dream, to rouse the careless man:&mdash; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Shall Turnus then such endless toil sustain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In fighting fields, and conquer towns in vain?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Win, for a Trojan head to wear the prize,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Usurp thy crown, enjoy thy victories?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bride and sceptre, which thy blood has bought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The king transfers; and foreign heirs are sought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go now, deluded man, and seek again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New toils, new dangers, on the dusty plain!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Repel the Tuscan foes; their city seize;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Protect the Latians in luxurious ease!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This dream all-powerful Juno sends; I bear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her mighty mandates, and her words you hear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Haste! arm your Ardeans; issue to the plain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With faith to friend, assault the Trojan train:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their thoughtless chiefs, their painted ships, that lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Tyber's mouth, with fire and sword destroy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Latian king, unless he shall submit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Own his old promise, and his new forget&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let him, in arms, the power of Turnus prove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And learn to fear whom he disdains to love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For such is heaven's command."&mdash;The youthful prince<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With scorn replied, and made this bold defence:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"You tell me, mother, what I knew before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Phrygian fleet is landed on the shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I neither fear nor will provoke the war;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My fate is Juno's most peculiar care.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But time has made you dote, and vainly tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of arms, imagined in your lonely cell.<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Go! be the temple and the gods your care;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Permit to men the thought of peace and war."<br /></span>
<span class="i4">These haughty words Alecto's rage provoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And frighted Turnus trembled as she spoke.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her eyes grow stiffened, and with sulphur burn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her hideous looks and hellish form return;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her curling snakes with hissings fill the place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And open all the furies of her face:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, darting fire from her malignant eyes,         <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">She cast him backward as he strove to rise,         <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, lingering, sought to frame some new replies.   <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">High on her head she rears two twisted snakes;        <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her chains she rattles, and her whip she shakes;      <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, churning bloody foam, thus loudly speaks:&mdash; <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Behold whom time has made to dote, and tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of arms, imagined in her lonely cell!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Behold the Fates' infernal minister!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">War, death, destruction, in my hand I bear."<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Thus having said, her smouldering torch, impressed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With her full force, she plunged into his breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aghast he waked; and, starting from his bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cold sweat, in clammy drops, his limbs o'erspread.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Arms! arms!" he cries: "my sword and shield prepare!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He breathes defiance, blood, and mortal war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, when with crackling flames a cauldron fries,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bubbling waters from the bottom rise:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the brims they force their fiery way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Black vapours climb aloft, and cloud the day.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The peace polluted thus, a chosen band<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He first commissions to the Latian land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In threatening embassy; then raised the rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To meet in arms the intruding Trojan guest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To force the foes from the Lavinian shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Italy's endangered peace restore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself alone an equal match he boasts,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With horns and hounds, a hunting match ordain,<span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pitch their toils around the shady plain. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Fury fires the pack; they snuff, they vent,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">'Twas of a well grown stag, whose antlers rise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High o'er his front, his beams invade the skies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From this light cause, the infernal maid prepares<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The country churls to mischief, hate, and wars.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The stately beast the two Tyrrhid&aelig; bred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Snatched from his dam, and the tame youngling fed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their father Tyrrheus did his fodder bring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tyrrheus, chief ranger to the Latian king:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their sister Silvia cherished with her care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The little wanton, and did wreaths prepare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hang his budding horns, with ribbons tied<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His tender neck, and combed his silken hide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bathed his body. Patient of command<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In time he grew, and, growing used to hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He waited at his master's board for food;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then sought his savage kindred in the wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where grazing all the day, at night he came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To his known lodgings, and his country dame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This household beast, that used the woodland grounds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was viewed at first by the young hero's hounds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As down the stream he swam, to seek retreat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the cool waters, and to quench his heat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ascanius, young, and eager of his game,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon bent his bow, uncertain in his aim:<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But the dire fiend the fatal arrow guides,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He falls; he fills the house with heavy groans,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Young Silvia beats her breast, and cries aloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For succour from the clownish neighbourhood:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The churls assemble; for the fiend, who lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the close woody covert, urged their way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One with a brand yet burning from the flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Armed with a knotty club another came:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whate'er they catch or find, without their care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their fury makes an instrument of war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tyrrheus, the foster-father of the beast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then clenched a hatchet in his horny fist,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But held his hand from the descending stroke, <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left his wedge within the cloven oak,     <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">To whet their courage, and their rage provoke.<span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now the goddess, exercised in ill,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ascends the roof, and to her crooked horn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such as was then by Latian shepherds borne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Adds all her breath. The rocks and woods around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mountains, tremble at the infernal sound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sacred lake of Trivia from afar,              <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Veline fountains, and sulphureous Nar,        <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shake at the baleful blast, the signal of the war.<span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Young mothers wildly stare, with fear possessed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And strain their helpless infants to their breast.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The clowns, a boisterous, rude, ungoverned crew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With furious haste to the loud summons flew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The powers of Troy, then issuing on the plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fresh recruits their youthful chief sustain:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But now, both parties reinforced, the fields<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A shining harvest either host displays,<br /></span>

<span class="i4">Thus, when a black-browed gust begins to rise,           <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">White foam at first on the curled ocean fries;           <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then roars the main, the billows mount the skies;        <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till, by the fury of the storm full blown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The muddy bottom o'er the clouds is thrown.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">First Almon falls, old Tyrrheus' eldest care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pierced with an arrow from the distant war:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fixed in his throat the flying weapon stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stopped his breath, and drank his vital blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Huge heaps of slain around the body rise:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the rest, the rich Galesus lies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A good old man, while peace he preached in vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amidst the madness of the unruly train:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Five herds, five bleating flocks, his pastures filled;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His lands a hundred yoke of oxen tilled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus, while in equal scales their fortune stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Fury bathed them in each other's blood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, having fixed the fight, exulting flies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bears fulfilled her promise to the skies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Juno thus she speaks:&mdash;"Behold! 'tis done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blood already drawn, the war begun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The discord is complete; nor can they cease<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dire debate, nor you command the peace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, since the Latian and the Trojan brood<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Speak, and my power shall add this office more:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The neighbouring nations of the Ausonian shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall hear the dreadful rumour, from afar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of armed invasion, and embrace the war."<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Then Juno thus:&mdash;"The grateful work is done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The seeds of discord sowed, the war begun:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frauds, fears, and fury, have possessed the state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fixed the causes of a lasting hate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bloody Hymen shall the alliance join<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Betwixt the Trojan and Ausonian line:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But thou with speed to night and hell repair;      <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For not the gods, nor angry Jove, will bear        <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy lawless wandering walks in upper air.          <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leave what remains to me." Saturnia said:               <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sullen fiend her sounding wings displayed,          <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unwilling left the light, and sought the nether shade.  <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i4">In midst of Italy, well known to fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There lies a lake (Amsanctus is the name)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Below the lofty mounts: on either side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thick forests the forbidden entrance hide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Full in the centre of the sacred wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An arm arises of the Stygian flood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, breaking from beneath with bellowing sound,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Here Pluto pants for breath from out his cell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And opens wide the grinning jaws of hell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To this infernal lake the Fury flies;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here hides her hated head, and frees the labouring skies.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Saturnian Juno now, with double care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Attends the fatal process of the war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The clowns, returned from battle, bear the slain,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The corpse of Almon, and the rest, are shown:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shrieks, clamours, murmurs, fill the frighted town.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ambitious Turnus in the press appears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, aggravating crimes, augments their fears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proclaims his private injuries aloud,                 <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A solemn promise made, and disavowed;                 <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">In woods and wilds the flags of Bacchus bear,             <span class="ir1a">}</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">Increase the clamour, and the war demand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Such was Amata's interest in the land,)<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Against all omens of their ill success.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fates averse, the rout in arms resort,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The raging tempest and the rising waves&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Propped on himself he stands; his solid sides<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wash off the sea-weeds, and the sounding tides&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So stood the pious prince unmoved, and long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sustained the madness of the noisy throng.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, when he found that Juno's power prevailed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the methods of cool counsel failed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He calls the gods to witness their offence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Disclaims the war, asserts his innocence.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Hurried by fate," he cries, "and borne before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A furious wind, we leave the faithful shore!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O more than madmen! you yourselves shall bear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The guilt of blood and sacrilegious war:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And pray to heaven for peace, but pray too late.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For me, my stormy voyage at an end,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I to the port of death securely tend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The funeral pomp which to your kings you pay,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Shut out the woes which he too well divined;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor with the rising storm would vainly strive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But left the helm, and let the vessel drive.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">A solemn custom was observed of old,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Two gates of steel (the name of Mars they bear,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Before his temple stand: the dire abode,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Are fenced with brazen bolts; without the gates,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wary guardian Janus doubly waits<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, when the sacred senate votes the wars,<span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Roman consul their decree declares,     <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in his robes the sounding gates unbars. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The youth in military shouts arise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the loud trumpets break the yielding skies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These rites, of old by sovereign princes used,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Deaf to their cries, nor would the gates unbar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sacred peace, or loose the imprisoned war;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But hid his head, and, safe from loud alarms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Abhorred the wicked ministry of arms.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then heaven's imperious queen shot down from high;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At her approach the brazen hinges fly;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gates are forced, and every falling bar;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, like a tempest, issues out the war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The peaceful cities of the Ausonian shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lulled in their ease, and undisturbed before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are all on fire; and some, with studious care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their restive steeds in sandy plains prepare;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some their soft limbs in painful marches try,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And war is all their wish, and arms the general cry.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Part scour their rusty shields with seam; and part<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New grind the blunted axe, and point the dart:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With joy they view the waving ensigns fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hear the trumpet's clangor pierce the sky.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Five cities forge their arms&mdash;the Atinian powers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Antemne, Tibur with her lofty towers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ardea the proud, the Crustumerian town:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All these of old were places of renown.<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Some hammer helmets for the fighting field;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some twine young sallows to support the shield;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The corselet some, and some the cuishes mould,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With silver plated, and with ductile gold.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rustic honours of the scythe and share<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give place to swords and plumes, the pride of war.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old faulchions are new tempered in the fires:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sounding trumpet every soul inspires.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The word is given; with eager speed they lace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shining head-piece, and the shield embrace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The neighing steeds are to the chariots tied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The trusty weapon sits on every side.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And, now the mighty labour is begun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ye Muses, open all your Helicon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sing you the chiefs that swayed the Ausonian land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their arms, and armies under their command;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What warriors in our ancient clime were bred;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What soldiers followed, and what heroes led.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For well you know, and can record alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What fame to future times conveys but darkly down.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Mezentius first appeared upon the plain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scorn sate upon his brows, and sour disdain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Defying earth and heaven. Etruria lost,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He brings to Turnus' aid his baffled host.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The charming Lausus, full of youthful fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rode in the rank, and next his sullen sire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To Turnus only second in the grace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of manly mien, and features of the face.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A skilful horseman, and a huntsman bred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fates averse a thousand men he led:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His sire unworthy of so brave a son;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Himself well worthy of a happier throne.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Next Aventinus drives his chariot round<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Latian plains, with palms and laurels crowned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proud of his steeds, he smokes along the field;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His father's hydra fills his ample shield:<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
<span class="i0">A hundred serpents hiss about the brims;         <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The son of Hercules he justly seems,             <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">By his broad shoulders and gigantic limbs&mdash; <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of heavenly part, and part of earthly blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A mortal woman mixing with a god.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For strong Alcides, after he had slain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The triple Geryon, drove from conquered Spain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His captive herds; and, thence in triumph led,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Tuscan Tyber's flowery banks they fed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, on mount Aventine, the son of Jove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The priestess Rhea found, and forced to love.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">For arms, his men long piles and javelins bore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And poles with pointed steel their foes in battle gore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like Hercules himself, his son appears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In savage pomp; a lion's hide he wears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About his shoulders hangs the shaggy skin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The teeth and gaping jaws severely grin.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus, like the god his father, homely drest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He strides into the hall, a horrid guest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then two twin-brothers from fair Tibur came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Which from their brother Tiburs took the name,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fierce Coras and Catillus, void of fear:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Armed Argive horse they led, and in the front appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like cloud-born Centaurs, from the mountain's height<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With rapid course descending to the fight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They rush along, the rattling woods give way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The branches bend before their sweepy sway.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Nor was Pr&aelig;neste's founder wanting there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom fame reports the son of Mulciber:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Found in the fire, and fostered in the plains,<span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A shepherd and a king at once he reigns,      <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leads to Turnus' aid his country swains.  <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His own Pr&aelig;neste sends a chosen band,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With those who plough Saturnia's Gabine land;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besides the succour which cold Anien yields,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rocks of Hernicus, and dewy fields,<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Anagnia fat, and father Amasene&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A numerous rout, but all of naked men:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor arms they wear, nor swords and bucklers wield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor drive the chariot through the dusty field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But whirl from leathern slings huge balls of lead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spoils of yellow wolves adorn their head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The left foot naked, when they march to fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in a bull's raw hide they sheath the right.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Messapus next, (great Neptune was his sire,)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Secure of steel, and fated from the fire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In pomp appears, and with his ardour warms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A heartless train, unexercised in arms:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The just Faliscans he to battle brings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And those who live where lake Ciminius springs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where Feronia's grove and temple stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who till Fescennian or Flavinian lands:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All these in order march, and marching sing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The warlike actions of their sea-born king;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a long team of snowy swans on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which clap their wings, and cleave the liquid sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, homeward from their watery pastures borne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They sing, and Asia's lakes their notes return.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not one, who heard their music from afar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would think these troops an army trained to war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But flocks of fowl, that, when the tempests roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With their hoarse gabbling seek the silent shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Then Clausus came, who led a numerous band<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of troops embodied from the Sabine land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, in himself alone, an army brought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas he the noble Claudian race begot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Claudian race, ordained, in times to come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To share the greatness of imperial Rome.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He led the Cures forth of old renown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mutuscans from their olive-bearing town,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the Eretian powers; besides a band<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That followed from Velinum's dewy land,<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And Amiternian troops, of mighty fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mountaineers, that from Severus came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the craggy cliffs of Tetrica,     <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And those where yellow Tyber takes his way,<span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where Himella's wanton waters play.    <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Casperia sends her arms, with those that lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Fabaris, and fruitful Foruli:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The warlike aids of Horta next appear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the cold Nursians come to close the rear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mixed with the natives born of Latine blood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom Allia washes with her fatal flood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not thicker billows beat the Libyan main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When pale Orion sets in wintery rain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor thicker harvests on rich Hermus rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or Lycian fields, when Ph&oelig;bus burns the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than stand these troops: their bucklers ring around;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their trampling turns the turf, and shakes the solid ground.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">High in his chariot then Halesus came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A foe by birth to Troy's unhappy name:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From Agamemnon born&mdash;to Turnus' aid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thousand men the youthful hero led,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who till the Massic soil, for wine renowned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fierce Auruncans from their hilly ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And those who live by Sidicinian shores,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And where with shoaly fords Vulturnus roars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cales' and Osca's old inhabitants,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rough Saticulans, inured to wants.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Light demi-lances from afar they throw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fastened with leathern thongs, to gall the foe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Short crooked swords in closer fight they wear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on their warding arm light bucklers bear.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Nor, [OE]balus, shalt thou be left unsung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From nymph Sebethis and old Telon sprung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who then in Teleboan Capri reigned;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that short isle the ambitious youth disdained,<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And o'er Campania stretched his ample sway,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where swelling Sarnus seeks the Tyrrhene sea&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er Batulum, and where Abella sees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From her high towers, the harvest of her trees.<a id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And these (as was the Teuton use of old)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wield brazen swords, and brazen bucklers hold;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sling weighty stones when from afar they fight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their casques are cork, a covering thick and light.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Next these in rank, the warlike Ufens went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And led the mountain troops that Nursia sent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rude &AElig;quicul&aelig; his rule obeyed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hunting their sport, and plundering was their trade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In arms they ploughed, to battle still prepared:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their soil was barren, and their hearts were hard.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Umbro the priest the proud Marrubians led,<span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">By king Archippus sent to Turnus' aid,      <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And peaceful olives crowned his hoary head. <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His wand and holy words, the viper's rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And venomed wounds of serpents, could assuage.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He, when he pleased with powerful juice to steep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their temples, shut their eyes in pleasing sleep.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But vain were Marsian herbs, and magic art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To cure the wound given by the Dardan dart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet his untimely fate the Angitian woods<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In sighs remurmured to the Fucine floods.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The son of famed Hippolytus was there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Famed as his sire, and, as his mother, fair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom in Egerian groves Aricia bore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nursed his youth along the marshy shore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where great Diana's peaceful altars flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In fruitful fields; and Virbius was his name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hippolytus, as old records have said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was by his stepdame sought to share her bed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, when no female arts his mind could move,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She turned to furious hate her impious love.<br /></span>
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Torn by wild horses on the sandy shore,        <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another's crimes the unhappy hunter bore,      <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glutting his father's eyes with guiltless gore.<span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">But chaste Diana, who his death deplored,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With &AElig;sculapian herbs his life restored:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Jove, who saw from high, with just disdain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dead inspired with vital breath again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Struck to the centre, with his flaming dart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The unhappy founder of the godlike art.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Trivia kept in secret shades alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her care, Hippolytus, to fate unknown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And called him Virbius in the Egerian grove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where then he lived obscure, but safe from Jove.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this, from Trivia's temple and her wood,       <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are coursers driven, who shed their master's blood,<span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Affrighted by the monsters of the flood.           <span class="ir1">}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">His son, the second Virbius, yet retained<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His father's art; and warrior steeds he reined.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Amid the troops, and like the leading god,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High o'er the rest in arms, the graceful Turnus rode:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A triple pile of plumes his crest adorned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On which with belching flames Chim&aelig;ra burned:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The more the kindled combat rises higher,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The more with fury burns the blazing fire.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fair I&ouml; graced his shield; but I&ouml; now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With horns exalted stands, and seems to low&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A noble charge! Her keeper by her side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To watch her walks, his hundred eyes applied;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the brims her sire, the watery god,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rolled from his silver urn his crystal flood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A cloud of foot succeeds, and fills the fields<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With swords, and pointed spears, and clattering shields;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where Ufens glides along the lowly lands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or the black water of Pomptina stands.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Last from the Volscians fair Camilla came,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Men, boys, and women, stupid with surprise,<br /></span>

&AElig;NE&Iuml;S, BOOK VII.</h2>


<h3 class="no-break">Note I.</h3>


<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Strange to relate! the flames, involved in smoke</i>, &amp;c.&mdash;P. 432.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="pmb2">Virgil, in this place, takes notice of a great secret in the Roman
divination: the lambent fires, which rose above the head, or played
about it, were signs of prosperity; such were those which he
observed in the second &AElig;ne&iuml;d, which were seen mounting from
the crown of Ascanius&mdash;</p>

<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Ecce, levis summo de vertice visus I&uuml;li</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Fundere lumen apex</i>.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="pmb3">Smoky flames (or involved in smoke) were of a mixed omen:
such were those which are here described; for smoke signifies
tears, because it produces them, and flames happiness. And
therefore Virgil says, that this ostent was not only <i>mirabile visu</i>,
but <i>horrendum</i>.</p>


<h3 class="no-break">Note II.</h3>

<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Only one daughter heirs my crown and state.</i>&mdash;P. 439.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="pmb3">This has seemed to some an odd passage; that a king should
offer his daughter and heir to a stranger prince, and a wanderer,
before he had seen him, and when he had only heard of his arrival
on his coasts. But these critics have not well considered the simplicity
of former times, when the heroines almost courted the marriage
of illustrious men. Yet Virgil here observes the rule of
   <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
decency: Lavinia offers not herself; it is Latinus, who propounds
the match; and he had been foretold, both by an augur and an
oracle, that he should have a foreign son-in-law, who was also a
hero;&mdash;fathers, in those ancient ages, considering birth and virtue,
more than fortune, in the placing of their daughters; which
I could prove by various examples; the contrary of which being
now practised, I dare not say in our nation, but in France, has
not a little darkened the lustre of their nobility. That Lavinia
was averse to this marriage, and for what reason, I shall prove in
its proper place.</p>


<h3 class="no-break">Note III.</h3>

<div class="block2">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">--------<i>And where Abella sees,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>From her high towers, the harvest of her trees.</i>&mdash;P. 458.<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="pmb3">I observe that Virgil names not Nola, which was not far distant
from Abella; perhaps, because that city (the same in which Augustus
died afterwards) had once refused to give him entertainment,
if we may believe the author of his life. Homer heartily
curses another city which had used him in the same manner; but
our author thought his silence of the Nolans a sufficient correction.
When a poet passes by a place or person, though a fair occasion
offers of remembering them, it is a sign he is, or thinks
himself, much disobliged.</p>

royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
